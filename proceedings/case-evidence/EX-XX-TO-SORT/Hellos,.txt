Hello,
Thank you for taking the time to read my correspondence. I do understand that you guys are not going to be able to deal with the foreclosure. Still, if you read down in the criminal violations, which are starting at a whole 28 new violations identified so far, but under the SEC area, it was the securities fraud that was done on a large scale I was told the SEC would deal with.  The SEC does securities fraud. Was I told right? Unfortunately, the CFPB has failed me as they had just forwarded the victim to the predator and asked them to try and work it out, to which Bank of America just said, "it's not us". Also, the BAR has not helped me get past the issue of a lack of any firm that doesn't have a conflict of interest with BoA that is also licensed in Idaho.  BoA did that on purpose to make it harder to have anyone go against them, leaving me to defend myself as a Pro Se. I am not a lawyer, and I shouldn't be doing this on my own.

I have tons of evidence of what BoA had done. Although the information I have presented as of yet is local in scope to me, it's not limited to my issues, nor is it souly about my foreclosure either. It is just the detail of the sample evidence. The foreclosure is just the immediate issue of mine, but in regards to the SEC, the bigger picture of my issues is that it's part of a much bigger fraud missed. I am flagging these sets of frauds that closely line up with a finding already rendered just last July, I believe, with BoA.  This fraud is a part of that same line of actions, but it's a whole new fraud set that was missed.

Here is the order for reference:

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 Release No. 97872 / July 11, 2023 INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940 Release No. 6342 / July 11, 2023 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING File No. 3-21524  In the Matter of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated; and BAC North America Holding Co.,  Respondents. ORDER INSTITUTING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 15(b) AND 21C OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND SECTION 203(e) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940, MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS AND CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDERS 

I am not saying I have bits of that, but that I uncovered more of yet another fraud that is inline with this.  Here

Please, I urge you to read and have a good look at the PDFs shared from Dropbox, and it will be clear what fraud they have done on 100s of 1000s of people just like me. I haven't seen any of the PDFs from Dropbox being accessed by anyone as of yet, but I know once they are reviewed, it will become clear why the SEC was contacted, as well as the other agencies. 

Again, I want to thank you for taking the time to read my correspondence.  

Sincerely, 
Jeremy Bass

CAUSE OF ACTION: ABUSE OF PROCESS

Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Abuse of process is defined as the wrongful use of legal proceedings for an ulterior purpose, not within the scope of the process, that is, to accomplish a result not intended by the process. Layton v. Brey, 122 Idaho 807, 839 P.2d 962 (1992).

In order to establish a claim for abuse of process, the plaintiff must prove that (1) the defendant used a legal process against the plaintiff, (2) the defendant had an ulterior motive or purpose in exercising such use, and (3) the defendant committed an act in the use of the process not proper in the regular prosecution of the proceedings. Kincheloe v. Farmers Union Co-op Ins. Co., 104 Idaho 337, 659 P.2d 498 (1983).

The ulterior motive or purpose may include, but is not limited to, harassment, delay, or an attempt to coerce the plaintiff to take some action not required by law. Jacox v. Regal Realty of Idaho, Inc., 98 Idaho 608, 570 P.2d 1168 (1977).

Defendants initiated foreclosure proceedings against the Plaintiff's property, as governed by Idaho Code §§ 45-1505 and 45-1506.

Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants acted with an ulterior motive or purpose in initiating the foreclosure proceedings, including, but not limited to, harassment, delay, or an attempt to coerce the Plaintiff to take some action not required by law.

Plaintiff further alleges that the Defendants committed acts in the use of the foreclosure process not proper in the regular prosecution of the proceedings, including, but not limited to, moving up the postponed trustee sale to occur on the Plaintiff's birthday, which may be considered an act of unprofessionalism and harassment.

As a direct and proximate result of the Defendants' wrongful use of legal proceedings for an ulterior purpose, the Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to, emotional distress, loss of time, and loss of the use and enjoyment of their property.

Pursuant to Idaho Code § 12-120(3), Plaintiff is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for judgment against Defendants as follows:

a. For general damages according to proof;
b. For punitive damages according to proof, as allowed by Idaho Code § 6-202 and § 6-205;
c. For an order enjoining Defendants from further wrongful use of legal process;
d. For an order setting aside the foreclosure sale, if applicable, pursuant to Idaho Code § 45-1502;
e. For reasonable attorney fees and costsElements of abuse of process:
Board of Education v. Farmingdale Classroom Teachers Ass'n, 38 N.Y.2d 397, 380 N.Y.S.2d 635 (1976) (explaining that the two elements of abuse of process are (1) regularly issued process, either civil or criminal, and (2) use of that process in a perverted manner to obtain a result not contemplated by law).
Use of legal process for an improper purpose:
Dean v. Kochendorfer, 237 N.Y. 384, 143 N.E. 229 (1924) (holding that the essence of the tort is the use of legal process for an improper purpose).
Malice:
Belsky v. Lowenthal, 62 A.D.2d 319, 405 N.Y.S.2d 62 (1978) (explaining that malice is a necessary element of abuse of process and may be inferred from the improper purpose).
Damages:
Williams v. Williams, 23 N.Y.2d 592, 298 N.Y.S.2d 473 (1969) (emphasizing that damages are required to establish a claim for abuse of process).

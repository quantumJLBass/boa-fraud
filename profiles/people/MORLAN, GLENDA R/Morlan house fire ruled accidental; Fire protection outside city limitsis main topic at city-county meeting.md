A spectacular Wednesday morning fire that destroyed a home at 3904 21st St. on the Nez Perce County side of the Lewiston city line has been ruled accidental by Idaho's chief deputy state fire marshal.

The fire appeared to have started inside a wall of a shop building separated from the house, probably from an electrical source, Nez Perce County Sheriff Randy Kingsbury said Thursday afternoon. "The investigator from Boise says it doesn't appear to be suspicious at all."

The investigator's preliminary opinion will become final once the written report is prepared, Kingsbury said. The investigator, Donald Dillard, said there will be no difference in the two, Kingsbury said.

Dillard, in addition to being chief deputy fire marshal, is supervisor of the arson/fraud unit. The fire marshal's office is a division of the Idaho Department of Insurance.

The owners, Kim and Glenda Morlan, and about a dozen other people, most residents of the same neighborhood, went to an intergovernmental meeting that included both Lewiston and Nez Perce County elected officials and staff Thursday night to complain about the lack of fire protection outside the city.

Lewiston firefighters left the scene after determining no one was inside the structures, following a long standing policy that was formally adopted just a year ago by the Lewiston City Council.

The Morlans have no insurance on the buildings or contents.

He built the house in 1991. The county assessor valued it last year at $157,314.

"It's been a tough year," Kim Morlan said Thursday night. It came down to choosing between maintaining insurance on his construction business or the house, and he chose to keep working, he said.

Financial difficulties fueled rumors while the house was still burning.

A foreclosure proceeding had been started against the property by the mortgage holder last January. It was cleared up, but a second action was pending this week.

Kingsbury said he had received an order to seize some personal property belonging to the Morlans the day of the fire. It wasn't served and the order was withdrawn Thursday. The items were destroyed in the fire, the sheriff said.

The shop where the fire started was about 10 feet from the attached garage and house, and wasn't part of a single structure as was mistakenly reported Thursday because of a reporter's error.

Kim Morlan said he was told the fire apparently smoldered inside the wall while gases from the insulation and other materials accumulated. When it finally exploded into flames, the 26-by-42-foot shop was consumed quickly, but not before it spread to the main structure.

Kim Morlan is one of two county residents representing the area of city impact on the Lewiston Planning and Zoning Commission. A few hours after the fire, he went to the commission meeting long enough to announce his resignation.

"It just came to me that if the city can pull up in the road in front of the fire and choose not to fight it and let it go, then why am I putting my time in for the city?" he said Thursday.

The city can argue that its insurance and liability prevents it from going outside, he said, "but there's a judgment call. They could have saved that house and they chose not to."

If the city has a policy that it only helps certain people, "then I don't want to be involved in that city."

Nez Perce County Commission Chairman J.R. Van Tassel said Morlan has done a good job for both the city and county on the commission. "I would hope he would reconsider. It's an emotional time."

The impromptu fire protection discussion at the Community Center Thursday night ran the gamut from blaming the city and county for not doing a better job of making sure fire protection existed to pleas for help in doing something now.

As soon as rural addressing is finished, probably about a month from now, Van Tassel said, the commission will try again. City representatives also promised support.

But it won't happen, Van Tassel warned, if there isn't strong support for forming some kind of protection district and a willingness to pay the cost.

That killed the last attempt to extend city service into the area of city impact, he said. It would have cost about $51.10 per $10,000 of property value, and a room full of angry people told him they didn't want the county ramming the district or the tax increase down their throats.

The previous attempt to form a fire district fell apart not long after 90 people from the center subdivision asked to be released.

Most of those who were opposed owned large amounts of land and would have been hit with a disproportionate percentage of the cost, said Ron Wittman, a farmer and developer who lives outside the impact area.

If the city wants to control what's happening in the impact area, it has to take care of the people who live there, he said.

This county has a long history of buildings burning because the vast majority won't pay for the service, Lewiston Fire Chief Thomas J. Tomberg said.

Lewiston Rural Fire District, which was trying to service 167 square miles of county from one station on the eastern edge of the Orchards, went out of business because people wouldn't pay a subscription fee, Tomberg said.

Of those who had fires and were helped by the rural department, only 18 percent paid their bills, he said.

It's a classic case of screwed up priorities, Kim Morlan said. Property should be saved first and then figure out how to pay for it.

Look to your neighbors, Councilman John A.K. Barker said. City residents have argued the city has no business sending firefighters to help people who aren't willing to help foot the bill.

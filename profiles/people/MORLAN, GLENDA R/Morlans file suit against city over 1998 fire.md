# Morlans file suit against city over 1998 fire

A couple whose home burnt down in a 1998 fire is suing the city of Lewiston and the Lewiston Fire Department.

Kim Ryan Morlan and Glenda Raye Morlan, whose home was on the outside edge of the Lewiston city limits, filed the lawsuit in 2nd District Court last week. They are asking for $325,000 in damages for what they say was the Lewiston Fire Department's breach of duty of care.

The fire allegedly started in the shop building outside the home from an electrical problem, according to the lawsuit, and from there spread to the house.

When firefighters arrived, Kim Morlan and others were allegedly fighting the fire with hoses. They moved away and stopped fighting the fire to allow the firefighters access, the lawsuit says.

The fire department determined the house was outside the city limits, the lawsuit alleges, and wouldn't fight the fire. But the length of time the department took to make the decision was long enough for the fire to grow out of control and destroy the house and shop and prevent Morlan and others from putting it out, the lawsuit alleges.

The Morlans are asking for $275,000 for the cost of the home and $50,000 for its contents.

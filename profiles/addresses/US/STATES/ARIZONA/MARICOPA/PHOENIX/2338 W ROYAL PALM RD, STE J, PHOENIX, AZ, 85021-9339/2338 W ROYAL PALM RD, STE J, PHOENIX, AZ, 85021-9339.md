The story of Hauf Law begins in February of 2013 when Adam’s employer shared she had sold the firm to someone who planned to implement a high volume approach. This news left him with a choice between staying or seeking another career path that allowed him to more freely express his personable style. As it had always been his dream to make a bigger difference in his community, the wheels began turning - it looked like the perfect opportunity to start his own bankruptcy firm. Conversations were had, finances were poured over and with his wife’s support, he moved forward with creating Hauf Law.     
​
As with many good prosperity stories, Hauf Law began in a small one-room office with three people. Cramped together in tight quarters, they worked with determination to offer Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcies to consumers in Arizona. Fueled by the belief that anything worthwhile in life requires sacrifices, Adam and Laura forged new paths in their life by releasing time with friends and family, utilizing their life savings and taking an equity loan on their home to ensure the firm’s success. 

Thankfully, their story does not stop there! Fast forward to today and you’ll find a couple quite satisfied with the risks they’ve taken which have resulted in a much larger office, a fuller staff, a healthy client base and community referral partnerships that enrich their client’s experiences. But the icing on the cake, for them, is the experiences they are able to have with their children as a result of their hard work. They can be frequently found having family days which most recently include trips to LEGO Land, Schnepf Farms, The North Pole Experience or pottery painting near their home.

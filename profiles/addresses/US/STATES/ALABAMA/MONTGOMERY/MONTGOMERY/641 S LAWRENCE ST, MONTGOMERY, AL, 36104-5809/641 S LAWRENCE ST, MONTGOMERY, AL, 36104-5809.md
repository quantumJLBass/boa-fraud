You can never get anyone on the phone, obviously drag their feet when dealing with or filing proper paperwork, and they just never answer the phone or get back to you in a timely manner. It sucks that they are super fast to take your money but when it comes to paying you what they owe, they take their sweet time.. and i would advise never, i mean NEVER get a car financed through credit acceptance

I'd leave negative stars if possible. Doesn't even deserve 1 star but Google says I have to. Their "attorneys" never answer the phone but want quick communication back from you. What a joke.

Clear communication when you can reach them, willing to negotiate on debt repayments. Did not harass workplace or use any shady tactics to my knowledge.

Only room for improvement is: could be a little more responsive by phone sometimes. If I tried morning and afternoon, I would get someone though not always on the first day I called.

Won't return my phone calls.  My credit card company sent them docs to collect in November, they filed in January, I received it in April (a week before my hearing, although that last part is the fault of my county court).  Called and called and no returned calls.  I actually paid my debt through the credit card company too

Starting to think this law firm uses the tactics of purposely not returning calls since they file frivolous lawsuits that we may or may NOT know anything about. By the time we do, they'll file a garnishment with your employer. Parnell & Parnell is still guaranteed money this way....even if you can't make contact with them. I saw reviews on BBB where the responder boasts about the firm being in business for over 40 years. How can you run a successful LAW FIRM, but take WEEKS to return 1 call?!

I've been calling AND emailing for WEEKS, almost daily, and I have only had 1 person return my calls...although she needs me to talk to someone else (who has YET to call me back). I'm simply trying to pay this debt, but due to a lack of responses, my checks will be garnished. Can't even pay with the original debt owners b/c they refer me BACK to them.

Seems to me the only time you're acknowledged is if they get spooked when you hire your own attorney, or, they aren't able to collect on a garnishment.

I will be looking more into reporting them for this because people who know the law should be held accountable...just like the consumers they sue. Nothing good can come from practices like this.

I have literally called over 100 times in a single day and received no answer. Not to mention the other days calling more than 20x. I have been trying to settle a debt for months with 0 communication on their behalf. When advised why they dont communicate in return, I was lied to and told they have contacted my client several times but have 0 records to when the calls were placed. Starting to wonder whos wanting money? Always given the run around but no one gives me any answers.

This company is terrible, I've been trying to get an issue resolved for almost a month now they almost never answer the phone and they do not call you back and if by chance you happen to speak with someone they are of no help. I wish I could give them negative stars.

This supposed law firm must never keep people employed because when you call their office no one answers - ever. They don't return your calls either. Pathetic service or lack thereof.

Worst company ever. Lied to multiple times, specifically by Brittany Logan. Said everyone works remotely and when we drove up there the parking lot was full and the person we had to speak to said specifically that she was there monday-friday. Brittany logan needs to be fired immediately for incompetence.

I hired these guys to act as my local counsel.  After agreeing to the engagement, they have ignored all phone calls and emails.  They totally suck.  I would caution you to avoid them.

I was an employee when the firm was Parnell & Crum P.A.. Mr.Crum is a very pleasant person to be around.  He had both hands full using his teeth to hold his cup of coffee stood holding the door open for me who had nothing in my arms. Mr. Ellis has gave me legal advise numerous times. His information always eased my worried mind. They both light up a room I have never seen ether one of them frown. They surpass 5 stars!

They keep calling my mother and then myself. They keep harassing my mother, who is on Hospice, asking for her to identify herself with her personal information. They got in touch with me. When I asked them, what did they want, they said they would not tell me until I sent them a POA. They preform like scammers; ergo, I can not help but believe they must be.

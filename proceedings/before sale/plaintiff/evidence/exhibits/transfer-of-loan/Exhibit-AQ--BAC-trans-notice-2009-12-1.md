**NOTICE OF ASSIGNMENT, SALE, OR TRANSFER OF SERVICING RIGHTS**

**Borrower Name & Address:**
Jeremy L. Bass
1515 21st Ave
Lewiston, ID 83501

**Account No.:** 213354943

You are hereby notified that the servicing of your mortgage loan, that is, the right to collect payments from you, is being assigned, sold, or transferred from Bank of America, N.A. to:

BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP, a subsidiary of Bank of America, N.A., effective 12/01/2009.

The assignment, sale, or transfer of the servicing of the mortgage loan does not affect any term or condition of the mortgage instruments, other than terms directly related to the servicing of your loan.

Except in limited circumstances, the law requires that your Lender send you this notice at least 15 days before the effective date of transfer or at closing. Your new servicer must also send you this notice no later than 15 days after this effective date or at closing. In this case, all necessary information is combined in this one notice.

Your Lender is Bank of America, N.A. If you have any questions relating to the transfer of servicing from your Lender, call Bank of America Customer Service at 1-800-432-1000 between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday. This is a toll-free number.

Your new servicer will be BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP.

The business address for your new servicer is: 450 American Street, Simi Valley, CA 93065-6285

The toll-free telephone number of your new servicer is 1-800-669-6607.

If you have any questions relating to the transfer of servicing to your new servicer, call Customer Service at 1-800-669-6607 between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.

The date that your Lender will stop accepting payments from you is 10/30/2009. The date that your new servicer will start accepting payments from you is 10/30/2009. Send all payments due on or after that date to your new servicer.

You should also be aware of the following information, which is set out in more detail in Section 6 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)(12 U.S.C. Section 2605):

During the 60-day period following the effective date of the transfer of the loan servicing, a loan payment received by your Lender before its due date may not be treated by the new loan servicer as late, and a late fee may not be imposed on you.

Section 6 of RESPA (12 U.S.C. Section 2605) gives you certain consumer rights. If you send a "qualified written request" to your loan servicer concerning the servicing of your loan, your servicer must provide you with a written acknowledgment within 20 business days of receipt of your request. A "qualified written request" is a written correspondence, other than notice on a payment coupon or other payment medium supplied by the servicer, which includes your name and account number, and your reasons for the request. If you want to send a "qualified written request" regarding the servicing of your loan, it must be sent to this address:

BAC Home Loans Servicing LP
Customer Service Correspondence CA6-919-01-41
P.O. Box 5170
Simi Valley, CA 93062-5170

Not later than 60 business days after receiving your request, your servicer must make any appropriate corrections to your account and must provide you with a written clarification regarding any dispute. During this 60-business-day period, your servicer may not provide information to a consumer reporting agency concerning any overdue payment related to such period or qualified written request. However, this does not prevent the servicer from initiating foreclosure if proper grounds exist under the mortgage documents.

A business day is a day on which the offices of the business entity are open to the public for carrying on substantially all of its business functions.

Section 6 of RESPA also provides for damages and costs for individuals or classes of individuals in circumstances where servicers are shown to have violated the requirements of that Section. You should seek legal advice if you believe your rights have been violated.

Bank of America, N.A.

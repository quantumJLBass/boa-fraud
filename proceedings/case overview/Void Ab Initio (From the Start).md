### Ways the Auction Could Be Proven Void Ab Initio (From the Start)

Here is a comprehensive analysis of how the foreclosure auction could be proven void ab initio, based on procedural, substantive, and legal grounds raised by Defendant Jeremy Bass:

### 1. **Wrong Instrument Foreclosed On**

- **Evidence**:
- Defendant asserts that the foreclosure was initiated on an incorrect Deed of Trust. The 2009 Letter of Full Reconveyance (Instrument No. 775252) extinguished the original Deed of Trust​(defendant-2024-11-24)​(Response to MSJ).
- Evidence includes conflicting loan terms between the instrument used for foreclosure and backdated loan documents submitted by the bank​(Response to MSJ).
- **Legal Basis**:
- Under **Idaho Code § 45-1508**, foreclosures based on defective or incorrect instruments are void, as no legal debt can be enforced under an invalid instrument​(MOTION FOR RECONSIDERAT…).

### 2. **Collusion and Auction Rigging**

- **Evidence**:
- Plaintiffs’ admissions in the Second Declaration of DPW Enterprises LLC confirm pre-auction communication with the trustee, violating Idaho’s Trust Deeds Act​(DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE TO…)​(Declaration of DPW Ente…).
- Video evidence and chat logs show collusive behavior, including prearranged bids and pre-printed checks matching exact amounts​(AFFIDAVIT OF JEREMY L. …)​(Response to MSJ).
- Emails sent by Defendant Bass warned the trustee of ongoing violations before the auction​(DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE TO…)​(AFFIDAVIT OF JEREMY L. …).
- **Legal Basis**:
- Idaho Code § 45-1506 requires auctions to be fair and open. Collusion invalidates the competitive nature required in public auctions​(Response to MSJ).
- Sherman Antitrust Act (15 U.S.C. § 1) prohibits bid rigging, which constitutes a felony. Such violations void the sale entirely​(DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE TO…).

### 3. **Lack of a Valid Default**

- **Evidence**:
- Defendant claims to have entered into a verbal agreement with the mortgage servicer to cure the default, supported by payments for taxes and insurance normally handled by escrow​(Response to MSJ)​(AFFIDAVIT OF JEREMY L. …).
- Lack of proper default notice, as required under Idaho Code § 45-1506, further invalidates the foreclosure​(DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE TO…)​(MOTION FOR RECONSIDERAT…).
- **Legal Basis**:
- Baker v. Nationstar Mortg., LLC clarifies that the absence of a valid default renders a foreclosure sale void ab initio​(MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT O…)​(MOTION FOR RECONSIDERAT…).

### 4. **Procedural Defects in Notice**

- **Evidence**:
- Incomplete and invalid notices to vacate, referencing non-existent attachments, were served​(DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE TO…)​(Response to MSJ).
- Video evidence of the auction demonstrates a lack of required public announcements, violating Idaho Code § 45-1506​(AFFIDAVIT OF JEREMY L. …).
- **Legal Basis**:
- Spencer v. Jameson holds that material defects in statutory notice requirements void the foreclosure sale​(MOTION FOR RECONSIDERAT…)​(MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT O…).

### 5. **Conflict of Interest**

- **Evidence**:
- IDEA Law Group acted as trustee despite conflicts of interest, having close ties with Carrington Mortgage Services​(Response to MSJ).
- Evidence of joint participation in industry events and shared boards raises concerns of impartiality​(Response to MSJ)​(MOTION FOR RECONSIDERAT…).
- **Legal Basis**:
- Trustees must act impartially under Idaho Code § 45-1506. A breach of fiduciary duty voids the sale​(Response to MSJ).

### 6. **Auction on Wrong Date and Terms**

- **Evidence**:
- The auction terms, including prearranged bid amounts and tailored checks, were communicated privately rather than announced at the auction​(Response to MSJ)​(DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE TO…).
- Plaintiffs presented evidence suggesting exact coordination with the trustee regarding bid requirements, violating fair trade principles​(DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE TO…)​(MOTION FOR RECONSIDERAT…).
- **Legal Basis**:
- Breckenridge Prop. Fund 2016, LLC v. Wally Enter. reaffirms that public auctions must operate under announced and equal terms. Any deviation renders the sale invalid​(MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT O…)​(MOTION FOR RECONSIDERAT…).

### 7. **Breach of Tenant Rights**

- **Evidence**:
- Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act (PTFA) requires a minimum 90-day notice for tenants like Pike. No valid notices were served​(AFFIDAVIT OF JEREMY L. …)​(Response to MSJ).
- **Legal Basis**:
- PTFA violations void the eviction process and question the legitimacy of the trustee sale’s post-sale proceedings​(DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE TO…).

### Supporting Logic for Void Status

- **Void vs. Voidable**:
- A void sale has no legal effect from the outset, as it violates foundational statutory or contractual requirements.
- A voidable sale remains valid until challenged but can be upheld under certain conditions. Defendant Bass’s evidence suggests void conditions.

### Summary

The auction appears void from the start based on:

1. Wrong instrument foreclosed on.
2. Collusion and auction rigging.
3. Lack of valid default.
4. Procedural defects in notice.
5. Trustee conflict of interest.
6. Prearranged terms violating public auction requirements.
7. Breach of tenant rights.

These points, supported by specific evidence and legal standards, demonstrate substantial grounds to invalidate the auction as void ab initio. Let me know if you’d like a structured legal memorandum for further clarity.

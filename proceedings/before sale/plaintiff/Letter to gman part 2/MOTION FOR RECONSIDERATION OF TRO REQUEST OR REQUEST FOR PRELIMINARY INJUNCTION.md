Bass, Pro Se 1 1515 21 st Ave 2 Lewiston, ID 83501-3926 3 Ph: 208-549-9584 4 Quantum.J.L.Bass@RAWdeal.io 5 6 IN THE DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SECOND JUDICIAL DISTRICT 7 FOR THE STATE OF IDAHO, IN AND FOR NEZ PERCE COUNTY 8 JEREMY L. BASS, Plaintiff, vs. MICHAEL J. NEWELL, c/o IDEA Law Group, LLC, ESQ, CARRINGTON MORTGAGE SERVICES, LLC, BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., RECONTRUST COMPANY, N.A., DOE I-X Defendants. Case No. CV35221875 MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF TRO REQUEST OR REQUEST FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION DEMAND FOR JURY 9 10 COMES NOW Plaintiff, JEREMY L. BASS (hereinafter "Mr. 11 Bass"), and respectfully moves this Court for reconsideration of 12 the previous denial of the temporary restraining order (TRO) 13 and/or injunction, prohibiting Defendants, specifically Mr. 14 Newell but including any other parties in this matter, from 15 proceeding with the scheduled trustee's sale of the property 16 located at 1515 21 ST AVE. LEWISTON ID 83501-3926 (hereinafter 17 "THE PROPERTY" or "HOUSE" fully described in further reading). 18 As grounds for this request, Mr. Bass respectfully asks the 19 Court to review the following arguments and legal authorities in 20 MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF TRO REQUEST OR REQUEST FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION PAGE 2 support of Mr. Bass' request: "The court may, by injunction, on 1 good cause shown, restrain the party in possession from doing 2 any act to the injury of real property during the foreclosure of 3 a mortgage thereon, or after a sale on execution before a 4 conveyance." 5 Pursuant to Idaho Code § 6-407 (2022), the court has the 6 authority to issue an injunction to protect the owner's rights 7 in real property during a foreclosure. Due to the ongoing 8 dispute over the property's ownership, the defendant's status as 9 a valid trustee is uncertain since the Defendant's right to hold 10 such a sale is intrinsically linked with the status of the 11 property's ownership, and therefore their authority to execute 12 the sale is questionable. Allowing the sale to proceed would 13 cause irreparable harm to the Plaintiff's property rights. 14 Therefore, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court 15 issue an injunction pursuant to Idaho Code § 6-407 to prevent 16 the defendant from selling the property until final judgment is 17 reached in this case, and to protect the Plaintiff's property 18 rights during this dispute. 19 20 Additionally, Idaho Code § 6-409 (2022) provides that 21 MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF TRO REQUEST OR REQUEST FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION PAGE 3 "An action for the recovery of real property against a person in 1 possession cannot be prejudiced by any alienation made by such 2 person, either before or after the commencement of the action." 3 4 The purpose of ID Code § 6-409 is to prevent a defendant in a 5 real property action from selling or transferring the property 6 to a third party in order to defeat the plaintiff's claim to the 7 property. In this case, the defendant has already attempted to 8 sell the property, and allowing the sale to proceed could 9 prejudice the Plaintiff's right to recover the property. 10 Therefore, the 11 12 Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court halt the sale 13 until final judgment is reached in this case, in accordance with 14 Idaho Code § 6-409 to ensure that the Plaintiff's right to 15 recover the property is protected. 16 17 Furthermore, Idaho Code § 6-418 (2022) provides that 18 "The owner in the main action is entitled to an execution to put 19 him in possession of his property in accordance with the 20 provisions of this act, but not otherwise." 21 22 MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF TRO REQUEST OR REQUEST FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION PAGE 4 This statute supports the Plaintiff's request for an injunction, 1 as it confirms that the owner in the main action is entitled to 2 possession of their property, and the Plaintiff is the owner in 3 the main action. Allowing the sale to proceed would interfere 4 with the Plaintiff's right to possession of their property. 5 Therefore, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court 6 issue an injunction in accordance with Idaho Code § 6-418 to 7 prevent the defendant from selling the property and interfering 8 with the Plaintiff's right to possession. 9 10 WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court 11 issue a temporary restraining order prohibiting the sale of the 12 property located at 1515 ST AVE. LEWISTON ID 83501-3926, and any 13 other relief the Court deems just and proper, 14 15 16 Dated this _24___ day of March 2023. Respectfully submitted, Jeremy L.

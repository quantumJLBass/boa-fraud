Jeff has poor communication. Waited 2 weeks for nothing. Not even a call back. Don't deal with this group of unprofessional.

It's been months of no communication for an adoption process started over a year ago. I've reached out a couple different times with no success. I don't even know if my son (stepson) is legally my son right now or not. If your seeking adoption help or divorce help, seek help somewhere else.

There's a lawyer at this firm that has had my trust for about 20 years... After taking all those years for resolution, He finally files a petition in 2021 (incorrectly might I add), then files it correctly monthes later resulting in me being the sole inherent; so why is it 2023 and I'm still waiting?! But what I do receive are promised deadlines that are not uphelded! It has truly become a headache (and yes, I have write to the Bar twice) . Please seek counsel elsewhere.... I wouldn't wish what I've gone through for anyone else!

Beware.  Read many existing reviews--is that the language legitimate clients would use?  This law firm not only overcharged for poor representation, they put several clauses in a decree that were in direct violation of federal and military law, which then caused expensive legal issues later.  When asked for them to represent again to help defend against their own mistakes, they denied me as a former client.  Costing me tens of thousands in new legal fees to basically just try and defend myself against violations of my rights that they put in the decree.  This is not a case of being a poor loser, I proved the information they put in was absolutely counter to several federal protection laws. If you are dealing with anything military related, stay clear of this firm.

I called when I was in desperate need of a real estate lawyer.  They answered my call immediately and filled out the the proper paperwork within a day.  This was so important to me because time was of the essence!  I would highly recommend this law firm. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

This law firm has been around for many years.  They are quite knowledgeable in family law.  I would recommend them to anyone needing their services.

The only people that rate lawyers 5 stars are the ones who they get off. I tried contacting them and never heard back.. So yeah.

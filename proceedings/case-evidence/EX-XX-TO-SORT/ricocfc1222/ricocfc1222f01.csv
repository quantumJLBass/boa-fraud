"Note: RICO denotes Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Includes persons in matters who were charged under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968. The lead charge is the primary basis for referring the matter to a U.S. attorney and is usually, but not always, the charge with the greatest possible sentence. See appendix table 1 for counts and additional data on the number of persons per investigation concluded and the average number of persons investigated.",,,,,,,,,

### **1. Challenge Plaintiffs' Bona Fide Purchaser Status**

The core of the Plaintiffs' case is their claim to be **bona fide purchasers** under **Idaho Code § 45-1508**. If we successfully dismantle this claim, their **ownership** and **right to possession** collapse, which is the foundation of their case for evicting both Mr. Bass and Mr. Pike. Here's the revised strategy.

Constructive fraud 


To prove constructive fraud, certain elements typically need to be present:

Existence of a Duty: There must be a legal or fiduciary duty between the parties. For instance, a trustee has a duty to act impartially and in the best interest of both the mortgagor and the mortgagee.
Breach of Duty: There must be a breach of this duty, even if there was no intent to defraud.
Unfair Advantage: The breach must result in an unfair advantage to one party and harm to the other.
Reliance and Damages: The harmed party must show that they relied on the representations or actions of the breaching party and suffered damages as a result.

Examples of Constructive Fraud:
Fiduciary Breach: A trustee fails to act impartially or engages in practices that benefit a certain party (such as a mortgagee or bidder) at the expense of the trustor (homeowner). Even without intent to harm, the breach of fiduciary duty resulting in financial loss or disadvantage to the homeowner can be seen as constructive fraud.
Property Transactions: If a property is sold at a significantly lower value during an auction because of undisclosed conflicts of interest or relationships between parties (e.g., the trustee colluding with a bidder), this can be classified as constructive fraud.
Misrepresentation Without Intent: A party provides inaccurate information without intent to deceive, but the affected party relies on this information and suffers harm as a result. This could be considered constructive fraud if there was a duty to provide accurate information.


# Transactions Voidable in Absence of Receipt of Reasonably Equivalent Value


Elements of a Voidable Transaction:

Lack of Reasonably Equivalent Value: For the transaction to be voidable, it must be shown that the homeowner did not receive a fair value for the property. A sale at half the market value clearly demonstrates this imbalance.
Financial Impact on the Debtor: The transaction must have left the debtor (homeowner) with insufficient capital, meaning they are unable to pay other debts or meet financial obligations due to the loss of equity. This aligns with the UVTA’s criteria for determining voidable transactions.

#### **A. The Foreclosure Sale Should Not Have Occurred Due to a Binding Pre-Sale Agreement**

**Argument**:  
The foreclosure sale on **February 29, 2024** was **unlawful** because **Mr. Bass had already entered into a binding verbal agreement** with the mortgage servicer, **Carrington Mortgage**, to **pay off the loan** in full. Under Idaho law, verbal contracts related to real estate are **valid and enforceable** when **part performance** demonstrates the existence of the agreement. Here, **Mr. Bass’s payment of taxes and insurance** is proof of the **execution of this pre-sale agreement**. Despite this, Carrington proceeded with the foreclosure sale, violating both **the agreement** and Idaho law.

- **Key Points**:
    
    - The agreement to **pay off the mortgage** had already been reached and executed by **Mr. Bass**, who had paid the taxes and insurance on the property as part of the agreement.
    - **No ongoing negotiations** were taking place because the agreement was already binding. The Trustee’s action in moving forward with the sale was improper and done in bad faith.
- **Supporting Evidence**:
    
    - **Proof of payment** for taxes and insurance by Mr. Bass as part of the pre-sale agreement.
    - **Affidavit of Mr. Bass**, attesting to the details of the pre-sale agreement and the Trustee’s knowledge of it.
- **Case Law**:
    
    - **Taylor v. Just, 138 Idaho 137 (2002)**: The **Idaho Supreme Court voided a trustee’s sale** because the grantor and beneficiary had entered into a **pre-sale agreement** that resolved the default, making the sale unnecessary. Similarly, the pre-sale agreement between Mr. Bass and the mortgage servicer **cured the default**, and the Trustee’s sale proceeded improperly.
    - **Federal National Mortgage Ass’n v. Hafer, 158 Idaho 694 (2015)**: The court voided a trustee's sale because the default had been resolved before foreclosure, rendering the sale unauthorized under Idaho law. The facts here are similar, as Mr. Bass had resolved the default.
    - **Security Pacific Finance Corp. v. Bishop, 109 Idaho 25 (1985)**: This case established that procedural defects in the non-judicial foreclosure process, such as moving forward despite a cured default, invalidate the sale. The procedural defect here was the Trustee's disregard of the agreement between Mr. Bass and the mortgage servicer.
- **Legal Doctrine: Promissory Estoppel**:
    
    - **Promissory estoppel** prevents a party from reneging on a promise when the other party has reasonably relied on it to their detriment. Mr. Bass reasonably relied on the agreement with Carrington Mortgage, performing his part by paying the taxes and insurance, which makes the foreclosure sale unjustifiable.
- **Legal Basis**:  
    Under **Idaho law**, the Trustee's sale is void because the **default had been cured** through the pre-sale agreement, as seen in the cases cited. Since the sale should never have occurred, the Plaintiffs cannot claim **bona fide purchaser status**, as they purchased the property in violation of a pre-existing agreement.
    

---

#### **B. Foreclosure Was Conducted Using the Wrong Instrument**

**Argument**:  
The foreclosure sale was **invalid** because **Carrington Mortgage** initiated the foreclosure based on an **incorrect instrument**. The servicing company admitted to the **Idaho Department of Finance** that the instrument used was not the one that should have been foreclosed on. This significant procedural error renders the foreclosure **legally void**.

- **Key Points**:
    
    - **Carrington Mortgage** used an incorrect Deed of Trust to foreclose, despite admitting to the Idaho Department of Finance that another instrument should have been used.
    - This procedural defect invalidates the entire foreclosure process, making the subsequent Trustee's sale invalid.
- **Supporting Evidence**:
    
    - **Documents from Carrington Mortgage** admitting to the Idaho Department of Finance that the wrong instrument was used.
    - **Correspondence with the Idaho Department of Finance**, confirming the error in the foreclosure instrument.
- **Legal Basis**:
    
    - Under **Idaho Code § 45-1508**, a sale conducted using the wrong instrument is **void**. The Idaho Supreme Court has held that when there are **procedural defects** in the foreclosure process, the sale must be set aside (**Security Pacific Finance Corp. v. Bishop, 109 Idaho 25 (1985)**). Since the wrong instrument was used, the Plaintiffs cannot claim bona fide purchaser status.

---

#### **C. The Trustee’s Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Bad Faith**

**Argument**:  
The Trustee breached their **fiduciary duty** by proceeding with the sale despite the **pre-existing agreement** that cured the default. The Trustee’s **duty of good faith** to both the lender and the borrower required them to postpone the sale in light of the agreement. Proceeding with the sale was a clear violation of this duty.

- **Key Points**:
    
    - The Trustee was fully aware of the **binding agreement** between Mr. Bass and Carrington Mortgage.
    - By proceeding with the foreclosure sale, the Trustee acted in bad faith, violating their fiduciary duty.
- **Supporting Evidence**:
    
    - **Affidavit of Mr. Bass**, detailing communications with the Trustee and their awareness of the payoff agreement.
    - **Documents or correspondence** showing that Carrington Mortgage and the Trustee knew about the agreement to cure the default.
- **Legal Basis**:
    
    - **Idaho Code § 45-1506** requires that a Trustee act in **good faith** when conducting a foreclosure sale. A **breach of fiduciary duty** can invalidate the sale, as seen in **Renz v. Wells Fargo Bank**. Since the Trustee knowingly disregarded the payoff agreement, the sale is invalid, and the Plaintiffs cannot be considered bona fide purchasers.

---

#### **D. Knowledge of Title Defects (Plaintiffs Not Bona Fide Purchasers)**

**Argument**:  
The Plaintiffs were fully aware of **defects in the title** and the ongoing dispute over the foreclosure. **Mr. Bass** made it publicly known at the auction that the sale was **rigged** and disputed. Additionally, a **poster had been displayed** in the window of the property for two years, detailing the ongoing legal issues. Given this **actual and constructive knowledge**, the Plaintiffs cannot claim to have acted in **good faith**.

- **Key Points**:
    
    - **Public Notice**: Mr. Bass’s public display at the auction and the poster in the window of the property provided **clear notice** to the Plaintiffs that the sale was disputed.
    - **Constructive Knowledge**: The Plaintiffs cannot claim ignorance of the legal issues when they had access to this information.
- **Supporting Evidence**:
    
    - **Photos of the Sign and Poster**: Showing that the Plaintiffs were informed of the dispute.
    - **Affidavit of Mr. Bass**: Attesting to the fact that the sale was contested and that this was made publicly known.
- **Legal Basis**:
    
    - Under **Idaho Code § 45-1508**, a purchaser with **actual knowledge of defects** in the title cannot claim to be a **bona fide purchaser**. The Plaintiffs had both actual and constructive knowledge of the disputed sale, making their claim to ownership invalid.

---

### **2. Procedural Defects in Foreclosure and Eviction**

Even if the court disregards the challenge to **bona fide purchaser status**, the Plaintiffs' case is still fatally flawed by significant **procedural defects** in both the foreclosure and eviction processes. These defects invalidate their right to possession.

---

#### **A. Invalid Eviction Notices**

**Argument**:  
The **eviction notices** served on both **Mr. Bass** and **Mr. Pike** were **legally defective**. The notices referenced an attached deed, which was never provided, leaving the recipients without sufficient information to understand the basis for the eviction.

- **Key Points**:
    
    - **Incomplete Notices**: The eviction notices were incomplete because they referenced a document (the deed) that was never attached.
    - **Legally Insufficient**: Without providing all required documentation, the notices are **invalid under Idaho law**.
- **Supporting Evidence**:
    
    - **Copies of the Eviction Notices**: Showing the missing attachments.
    - **Affidavits of Mr. Bass and Mr. Pike**: Confirming that the referenced deed was never included with the notice.
- **Legal Basis**:
    
    - Under **Idaho Code § 6-303**, an eviction notice must be complete and provide all required documentation. A **defective notice** is insufficient to support an eviction. Since the notices were incomplete, the Plaintiffs cannot proceed with the eviction.

---

#### **B. No Three-Day Notice for Nonpayment of Rent (Mr. Pike)**

**Argument**:  
The Plaintiffs have not served **Mr. Pike** with a valid **three-day notice** for nonpayment of rent. Even if they claim that rent was not paid, **Idaho law** requires that they serve a proper notice before initiating eviction proceedings, which they failed to do.

- **Key Points**:
    
    - **No Three-Day Notice**: The Plaintiffs never served the required notice for nonpayment of rent on Mr. Pike.
    - **Legal Requirement**: Idaho law mandates that landlords serve a three-day notice for nonpayment before eviction proceedings can begin.
- **Supporting Evidence**:
    
    - **Affidavit of Mr. Pike**: Testifying that he never received a valid three-day notice for nonpayment of rent.
- **Legal Basis**:
    
    - Under **Idaho Code § 6-303**, a landlord must serve a **three-day notice** for nonpayment of rent before initiating an eviction. Since the Plaintiffs failed to meet this requirement, the eviction cannot proceed against Mr. Pike.

---

### **3. Mr. Pike’s Lease and PTFA Protections**

Even if the court finds that the Plaintiffs are bona fide purchasers or ignores the procedural defects, **Mr. Pike’s lease** and protections under the **Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act (PTFA)** provide additional defenses.

---

#### **A. Valid Lease and Pre-Sale Agreement**

**Argument**:  
Mr. Pike’s lease was validly renewed on **February 28, 2024**, one day before the foreclosure sale, as part of a **binding pre-sale agreement**. At that time, there was no reason to expect the foreclosure to occur, given the pre-sale agreement between Mr. Bass and Carrington Mortgage. **Mr. Pike’s lease remains valid** and enforceable, and the Plaintiffs must honor it or provide **90 days’ notice**.

- **Key Points**:
    
    - **Valid Lease**: The lease was signed in good faith the day before the foreclosure, and neither party expected the sale to take place, due to the pre-existing agreement to cure the default.
    - **90-Day Notice Requirement**: Even if the Plaintiffs contest the lease, **federal law under the PTFA** requires them to provide Mr. Pike with **90 days’ notice** before eviction.
- **Supporting Evidence**:
    
    - **Residential Lease Agreement**: Signed between Mr. Pike and Mr. Bass on **February 28, 2024**.
    - **Affidavit of Mr. Bass and Mr. Pike**: Confirming the lease was signed as part of the normal process, with no expectation of a foreclosure.
- **Legal Basis**:
    
    - The **Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act (PTFA)** requires purchasers of foreclosed properties to either honor **existing bona fide leases** or provide **90 days’ notice** before eviction. Mr. Pike’s lease was validly renewed before the foreclosure, and the Plaintiffs must either honor it or provide the required notice under **12 U.S.C. § 5220**.

---

#### **B. Plaintiffs Failed to Redirect Rent Payments**

**Argument**:  
The Plaintiffs failed to provide **clear instructions** for **redirecting rent payments** after the foreclosure. Mr. Pike continued paying rent to **Mr. Bass**, as the **Notice to Vacate** did not properly direct him to pay the rent to the Plaintiffs.

- **Key Points**:
    
    - **Lack of Direction**: The Plaintiffs did not properly notify Mr. Pike of where to send rent payments after the foreclosure.
    - **Compliance with Lease**: Mr. Pike continued to comply with his lease by paying rent to Mr. Bass, as the Plaintiffs failed to provide alternative instructions.
- **Supporting Evidence**:
    
    - **Affidavit of Mr. Pike**: Confirming that he continued paying rent to Mr. Bass because the Notice to Vacate did not provide clear instructions on where to send rent payments.
- **Legal Basis**:
    
    - Under the **PTFA**, tenants are required to comply with their lease obligations. Since Mr. Pike followed the instructions provided to him and continued paying rent, he is not in default. The Plaintiffs cannot claim nonpayment as grounds for eviction.

---

### **4. Challenge to Plaintiffs' Request for Writ of Ejectment**

Finally, the Plaintiffs’ request for a **writ of ejectment** is premature and invalid because they have failed to meet the necessary **legal requirements for eviction**.

---

#### **A. Plaintiffs Failed to Serve Proper Eviction Notices**

**Argument**:  
The Plaintiffs’ request for a writ of ejectment is invalid because they failed to serve **proper eviction notices** on both **Mr. Bass** and **Mr. Pike**. The notices were incomplete and failed to meet the legal requirements under Idaho law.

- **Key Points**:
    
    - **Incomplete Notices**: The eviction notices were legally defective because they referenced an attached deed that was never provided.
    - **Failure to Serve Valid Notice**: Without valid notices, the Plaintiffs have no legal basis for their request for ejectment.
- **Supporting Evidence**:
    
    - **Copies of Eviction Notices**: Showing the missing attachments.
    - **Affidavits of Mr. Bass and Mr. Pike**: Confirming that the referenced deed was never provided with the eviction notice.
- **Legal Basis**:
    
    - Under **Idaho Code § 6-303**, an eviction notice must provide all necessary information to inform the recipient of the grounds for eviction. Since the notices were defective, the Plaintiffs’ request for a **writ of ejectment** is invalid.

---

### **5. The Principle of Favoring the Non-Moving Party**

In all of the defenses raised, we also emphasize that as the **non-moving party**, the court is obligated to **liberally construe the facts** in favor of Mr. Bass and Mr. Pike, along with all reasonable inferences from the evidence.

- **Legal Precedent**:
    - **Suitts v. First Sec. Bank of Idaho, N.A., 125 Idaho 27, 31 (Idaho Ct. App. 1994)**: “The court should liberally construe the facts in favor of the party opposing the motion, together with all reasonable inferences from the evidence.”
    - **Bunker Hill Co. v. United Steelworkers of America, 107 Idaho 155 (1984)** and **Anderson v. City of Pocatello, 112 Idaho 176 (1986)**: The court must draw reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of the non-moving party.



This Court has held that "in order to establish the prima facie case for unjust enrichment, the plaintiff must show that there was: (1) a benefit conferred upon the defendant by the plaintiff; (2) appreciation by the defendant of such benefit; and (3) acceptance of the benefit under circumstances that would be inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without payment to the plaintiff of the value thereof." Curtis v. Becker, 130 Idaho 378, 382, 941 P.2d 350, 354 (1997) (citing Idaho Lumber, Inc. v. Buck, 109 Idaho 737, 745, 710 P.2d 647, 655 (Ct. App. 1985)).

Aberdeen-Springfield Canal Company v. Peiper, 133 Idaho 82, 88 (Idaho 1999)




### § 55-908. Fraud is a question of fact.
In all cases arising under the provisions of chapters 5 to 9 inclusive, of this title, the question of fraudulent intent is one of fact, and not of law; nor can any transfer or charge be adjudged fraudulent solely on the ground that it was not made for a valuable consideration.




imprisonment ended; hence, plaintiff’s claim was timely. McCabe v. Craven, 145 Idaho 954, 188 P.3d 896 (2008).

Chapter 7 trustee’s adversary proceeding alleging that a notary public and the notary’s employer were liable under§ 51-118 for damages the notary caused when she notarized the forged signature of a debtor on a deed of trust was not time-barred, even though the trustee filed his adversary proceeding on March 25, 2009, more than three years after the notary notarized the debtor’s signature. Subsection (4) of this section gave the debtor two years from the date he discovered the notary’s misconduct to file a lawsuit. The debtor discovered the notary’s conduct in May 2006, and declared bankruptcy on March 28, 2008. 11 U.S.C.S. § 108 extended the period the trustee had to file his adversary proceeding until March 28, 2010. Gugino v. Alliance Title & Escrow Corp. (In re Ganier), 2010 Bankr. LEXIS 1444 (Bankr. D. Idaho May 3, 2010). Products liability cause of action against a manufacturer of a hip device was not property of the estate where, even though it was implanted pre-petition and debtor began experiencing pain pre-petition, his injury had not accrued under Idaho law, as it was not objectively ascertainable. Nor was the cause of action sufficiently rooted in the pre-bankruptcy past, because on the day of the bankruptcy filing, it remained only a nebulous possibility that the device would cause him injury. In re Bolton, 584 B.R. 44 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2018).


This section, which comprised 1957, ch. 181, § 1, p. 345, was repealed by S.L. 1967, ch. 118, § 1.

### § 45-1502. Definitions — Trustee’s charge.
As used in this act:

“Beneficiary” means the person named or otherwise designated in a trust deed as the person for whose benefit a trust deed is given, or his successor in interest, and who shall not be the trustee.
“Grantor” means the person conveying real property by a trust deed as security for the performance of an obligation.
“Trust deed” means a deed executed in conformity with this act and conveying real property to a trustee in trust to secure the performance of an obligation of the grantor or other person named in the deed to a beneficiary.
“Trustee” means a person to whom title to real property is conveyed by trust deed, or his successor in interest for the limited purpose of the power of sale contained in this chapter upon the occurrence of certain contingencies set forth in such trust deed, and the obligation to reconvey the deed of trust pursuant to section 45-1514, Idaho Code. All other incidents of ownership of such real property shall remain with the grantor. For the purpose of section 45-1506(2)(c), Idaho Code, a trustee is not a party requiring notice of sale.
“Real property” means any right, title, interest and claim in and to real property owned by the grantor at the date of execution of the deed of trust or acquired thereafter by said grantor or his successors in interest. Provided, nevertheless, real property as so defined which may be transferred in trust under this act shall be limited to: (a) any real property located within an incorporated city or village at the time of the transfer; (b) any real property not exceeding eighty (80) acres, regardless of its location, provided that such real property is not principally used for the agricultural production of crops, livestock, dairy or aquatic goods; or (c) any real property not exceeding forty (40) acres regardless of its use or location.
The trustee shall be entitled to a reasonable charge for duties or services performed pursuant to the trust deed and this chapter, including compensation for reconveyance services notwithstanding any provision of a deed of trust prohibiting payment of a reconveyance fee by the grantor or beneficiary, or any provision of a deed of trust which limits or otherwise restricts the amount of a reconveyance fee to be charged and collected by the trustee. A trustee shall be entitled to refuse to reconvey a deed of trust until the trustee’s reconveyance fees and recording costs for recording the reconveyance instruments are paid in full. The trustee shall not be entitled to a foreclosure fee in the event of judicial foreclosure or work done prior to the recording of a notice of default. If the default is cured prior to the time of the last newspaper publication of the notice of sale, the trustee shall be paid a reasonable fee.




### § 45-1503. Transfers in trust to secure obligation — Foreclosure.
Transfers in trust of any estate in real property as defined in section 45-1502(5), Idaho Code, may hereafter be made to secure the performance of an obligation of the grantor or any other person named in the deed to a beneficiary. Where any transfer in trust of any estate in real property is hereafter made to secure the performance of such an obligation, a power of sale is hereby conferred upon the trustee to be exercised after a breach of the obligation for which such transfer is security, and a deed of trust executed in conformity with this act may be foreclosed by advertisement and sale in the manner hereinafter provided, or, at the option of beneficiary, by foreclosure as provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property. If any obligation secured by a trust deed is breached, the beneficiary may not institute a judicial action against the grantor or his successor in interest to enforce an obligation owed by the grantor or his successor in interest unless:
The trust deed has been foreclosed by advertisement and sale in the manner provided in this chapter and the judicial action is brought pursuant to section 45-1512, Idaho Code; or
The action is one for foreclosure as provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property; or
The beneficiary’s interest in the property covered by the trust deed is substantially valueless as defined in subsection (2) of this section, in which case the beneficiary may bring an action against the grantor or his successor in interest to enforce the obligation owed by grantor or his successor in interest without first resorting to the security; or
The action is one excluded from the meaning of “action” under the provisions of section 6-101(3), Idaho Code.
As used in this section, “substantially valueless” means that the beneficiary’s interest in the property covered by the trust deed has become valueless through no fault of the beneficiary, or that the beneficiary’s interest in such property has little or no practical value to the beneficiary after taking into account factors such as the nature and extent of the estate in real property which was transferred in trust; the existence of senior liens against the property; the cost to the beneficiary of satisfying or making current payments on senior liens; the time and expense of marketing the property covered by the deed of trust; the existence of liabilities in connection with the property for clean up of hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants; and such other factors as the court may deem relevant in determining the practical value to the beneficiary of the beneficiary’s interest in the real property covered by the trust deed.


### § 45-1504. Trustee of trust deed — Who may serve — Successors.
The trustee of a trust deed under this act shall be:
Any member of the Idaho state bar;
Any bank or savings and loan association authorized to do business under the laws of Idaho or the United States;
An authorized trust institution having a charter under chapter 32, title 26, Idaho Code, or any corporation authorized to conduct a trust business under the laws of the United States; or
A licensed title insurance agent or title insurance company authorized to transact business under the laws of the state of Idaho.
The trustee may resign at its own election or be replaced by the beneficiary. The trustee shall give prompt written notice of its resignation to the beneficiary. The resignation of the trustee shall become effective upon the recording of the notice of resignation in each county in which the deed of trust is recorded. If a trustee is not appointed in the deed of trust, or upon the resignation, incapacity, disability, absence, or death of the trustee, or the election of the beneficiary to replace the trustee, the beneficiary shall appoint a trustee or a successor trustee. Upon recording the appointment of a successor trustee in each county in which the deed of trust is recorded, the successor trustee shall be vested with all powers of an original trustee.



A beneficiary was not precluded from recovering a statutory deficiency judgment allowed by§ 45-1512 by waiver or estoppel because the notice of trustee’s sale stated that “the beneficiary elects to sell or cause the trust property to be sold to satisfy said obligation.” Frontier Federal Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. Douglass, 123 Idaho 808, 853 P.2d 553, cert. denied, 510 U.S. 917, 114 S. Ct. 309, 126 L. Ed. 2d 257 (1993). Lender complied with this section in effecting a foreclosure sale of Chapter 11 debtors’ property where the deed of trust was recorded, the debtors were in default, a notice of default stating the debtors’ breach was recorded, and the debtors were properly served; the claim by the debtors that the lender did not provide the notice required by the deed of trust did not invalidate the sale because the debtors failed to establish that the alleged breach of the deed of trust would vitiate the statutory foreclosure process. Thorian v. BARO Enters., LLC (In re Thorian), 387 B.R. 50 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2008).

Procedure.
In 1957,§§ 45-901 and 45-904 were amended to eliminate trust deeds from their operation and likewise the mortgage laws, directing attention to§§ 6-101 and 6-104 which were amended to draw a distinction between a trust deed or transfer in trust and a mortgage to the effect that mortgage foreclosure proceedings are not applicable to proceedings for the foreclosure of a trust deed by advertisement or notice and sale as authorized by chapter 181, such procedure being set out in§ 45-1503, this section also requiring the recording of the trust deed and any assignment thereof and§ 45-1506 requiring notice of trustee sale, setting up details of the complete procedure for sale. Roos v. Belcher, 79 Idaho 473, 321 P.2d 210 (1958).




(8) The sale shall be held on the date and at the time and place designated in the notice of sale or notice of rescheduled sale as provided in section 45-1506A, Idaho Code, unless the sale is postponed as provided in this subsection or as provided in section 45-1506B, Idaho Code, respecting the effect of an intervening stay or injunctive relief order. The trustee shall sell the property in one (1) parcel or in separate parcels at auction to the highest bidder. Any person, including the beneficiary under the trust deed, may bid at the trustee’s sale. The attorney for such trustee may conduct the sale and act in such sale as the auctioneer of trustee. The trustee may postpone the sale of the property upon request of the beneficiary by publicly announcing at the time and place originally fixed for the sale the postponement to a stated subsequent date and hour. No sale may be postponed to a date more than thirty (30) days subsequent to the date from which the sale is postponed. A postponed sale may itself be postponed in the same manner and within the same time limitations as provided in this subsection. For any loan made by a state or federally regulated beneficiary, which loan is secured by a deed of trust encumbering the borrower’s primary residence as determined pursuant to section 45-1506C(1), Idaho Code, the trustee, prior to conducting any trustee’s sale previously postponed pursuant to this section, shall mail notice of such trustee sale at least fourteen (14) days prior to conducting such sale by the same means and to the same persons as provided in subsection (2) of this section. The trustee or beneficiary shall, prior to conducting the trustee’s sale, record an affidavit of mailing confirming that such notice has been mailed as required by this section. The filing of such affidavit of mailing is conclusive evidence of compliance with this section as to any party relying on said affidavit of mailing.



### § 45-1506A. Rescheduled sale — Original sale barred by stay — Notice of rescheduled sale.
In the event a sale cannot be held at the time scheduled by reason of automatic stay provisions of the U.S. bankruptcy code (11 U.S.C. 362), or a stay order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the sale may be rescheduled and conducted following expiration or termination of the effect of the stay in the manner provided in this section.
Notice of the rescheduled sale shall be given at least thirty (30) days before the day of the rescheduled sale by registered or certified mail to the last known address of all persons who were entitled to notice by mail of the original sale and to any person who shall have recorded a request for notice of sale at least forty-five (45) days prior to the rescheduled sale date in the form and manner required by section 45-1511, Idaho Code, provided that recording the request prior to notice of default is, for the purposes of this section only, waived.
Notice of the rescheduled sale shall be published in the newspaper of original publication once a week for three (3) successive weeks, making three (3) publishings in all, with the last publication to be at least ten (10) days prior to the day of sale.
The trustee shall make an affidavit stating that he or she has complied with subsections (2) and (3) of this section. The trustee shall make the above affidavit available for inspection at the time of the rescheduled sale together with any affidavit of mailing and posting, when required, which was not of record as required by subsection (7) of section 45-1506, Idaho Code, when the stay became effective. The affidavit or affidavits shall be attached to or incorporated in the trustee’s deed.



Effective Dates.
Section 4 of S.L. 2011, ch. 323 provided: “This act shall be in full force and effect on and after September 1, 2011.”

### § 45-1507. Proceeds of sale — Disposition.
The trustee shall apply the proceeds of the trustee’s sale as follows:

To the expenses of the sale, including a reasonable charge by the trustee and a reasonable attorney’s fee.
To the obligation secured by the trust deed.
To any persons having recorded liens subsequent to the interest of the trustee in the trust deed as their interests may appear.
The surplus, if any, to the grantor of the trust deed or to his successor in interest entitled to such surplus.
History.
1957, ch. 181, § 7, p. 345.






### § 45-1508. Finality of sale.
A sale made by a trustee under this act shall foreclose and terminate all interest in the property covered by the trust deed of all persons to whom notice is given under section 45-1506, Idaho Code, and of any other person claiming by, through or under such persons and such persons shall have no right to redeem the property from the purchaser at the trustee’s sale. The failure to give notice to any of such persons by mailing, personal service, posting or publication in accordance with section 45-1506, Idaho Code, shall not affect the validity of the sale as to persons so notified nor as to any such persons having actual knowledge of the sale. Furthermore, any failure to comply with the provisions of section 45-1506, Idaho Code, shall not affect the validity of a sale in favor of a purchaser in good faith for value at or after such sale, or any successor in interest thereof.

History.


Fair Market Value.
Expenses of the trustee’s sale, including a reasonable charge by the trustee and a reasonable attorney’s fee incurred up to the time of sale, interest accrued from the date of sale to the date of judgment at the rate provided in the promissory note, and costs of the action for a deficiency and reasonable attorney fees incurred in the action were recoverable by the beneficiary in an action to obtain a deficiency judgment. Farber v. Howell, 111 Idaho 132, 721 P.2d 731 (Ct. App. 1986). Fair Market Value.

The district court was correct in not accepting construction cost as the equivalent of fair market value in a suit for a deficiency judgment following a nonjudicial foreclosure sale of property subject to a deed of trust. Logan v. Grand Junction Assocs., 111 Idaho 670, 726 P.2d 782 (Ct. App. 1986).

The district court committed reversible error in holding that the plaintiffs failed in their burden to prove a deficiency because the experts were unable to agree on a particular figure; the district court must reconsider, compare and weigh the evidence as a fact finder and determine the fair market value of the property in question. Logan v. Grand Junction Assocs., 111 Idaho 670, 726 P.2d 782 (Ct. App. 1986).




Property Owner’s Opinion as to Value.
In determining the fair market value of the property, the property owner has the right to render an opinion concerning the value of his property. Evans v. Sawtooth Partners, 111 Idaho 381, 723 P.2d 925 (Ct. App. 1986).




Sufficient Proof of Value.
Where there was evidence of an offer of $325,000, one appraiser valued the property at $265,000, and another appraiser valued the property at $340,000, there was sufficient evidence to support the judge’s finding that the property was worth at least the amount of the indebtedness at the time of the trustee’s sale, approximately $317,000. Evans v. Sawtooth Partners, 111 Idaho 381, 723 P.2d 925 (Ct. App. 1986).









The doctrine of quasi-estoppel applies when a party asserts a position or claim inconsistent with one previously taken, with knowledge of the facts and of his or her rights, to the detriment of the party seeking application of the doctrine. Sun Valley Hot Springs Ranch, Inc. v. Kelsey, 131 Idaho 657, 662, 962 P.2d 1041, 1046 (1998); The Highlands, Inc. v. Hosac, 130 Idaho 67, 70, 936 P.2d 1309, 1312 (1997); Willig v. Dep't of Health Welfare, 127 Idaho 259, 261, 899 P.2d 969, 971 (1995); Mitchell v. Zilog, Inc., 125 Idaho 709, 715, 874 P.2d 520, 526 (1994); KTVB v. Boise City, 94 Idaho 279, 281-82, 486 P.2d 992, 994-95 (1971). The inconsistent position must have procured some advantage to the challenged party or produced some disadvantage to the other; or the person invoking the estoppel must have been induced to change his position.

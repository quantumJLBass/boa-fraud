Item 1117 of Regulation AB, Legal Proceedings.

Countrywide Home Loans hereby notifies you of the following:

Certain state and local government officials have filed proceedings against
Countrywide Financial Corporation, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. ("Countrywide")
and Countrywide Home Loans Servicing LP ("Countrywide Servicing"), including,
among others, lawsuits brought by the state attorneys general of California,
Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana and West Virginia. The lawsuits allege,
among other things, that Countrywide Financial Corporation, Countrywide and
Countrywide Servicing violated state consumer protection laws by engaging in
deceptive marketing practices designed to increase the volume of loans they
originated and then sold into the secondary market and (according to certain of
the complaints) by improperly servicing loans. The lawsuits seek various
remedies, including among other things, restitution, other monetary relief,
penalties and rescission or reformation of mortgage loans made to consumers. In
addition, the Director of the Washington State Department of Financial
Institutions has commenced an administrative proceeding against Countrywide
alleging, among other things, that Countrywide did not provide borrowers with
certain required disclosures and that the loan products made available to
Washington borrowers of protected races or ethnicities were less favorable than
those made available to other similarly situated borrowers.

On October 6, 2008, Bank of America Corporation ("Bank of America") announced
settlements in relation to allegations of unfair and deceptive marketing
practices with the states attorneys general of several states, including
Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, North
Carolina, Ohio, Texas and Washington (such states, together with such additional
states that enter into settlements, the "Settling States"). The settlement with
the Attorney General of Washington does not address the pending administrative
action. Following its settlement announcement on October 6, 2008, Bank of
America entered into settlements with the states attorneys general of Delaware,
Kansas, Nevada and Pennsylvania, and has engaged in negotiations, and may have
entered into other settlements, with additional states attorneys general. The
cornerstone of the settlements is a loan modification program for subprime
borrowers and pay option ARM borrowers designed to avoid foreclosures, along
with a nationwide fund of up to $150 million for payments to borrowers who have
already experienced foreclosure. While the loan modifications to be made
pursuant to the settlements with the Settling States are intended to both avoid
unnecessary foreclosures and increase recoveries relative to foreclosing on
defaulted borrowers, the ultimate effectiveness of these modifications in
mitigating losses on Countrywide mortgage loans cannot be predicted with
certainty. This loan modification program could result in more modifications of
the original terms of Countrywide mortgage loans, more delinquent and
defaulted Countrywide mortgage loans, delays in foreclosures and liquidations
with respect to defaulted Countrywide mortgage loans and/or permanent
forgiveness of a portion of the amounts owing in respect of the related
Countrywide mortgage loans, which could result in delays and reductions in
distribution to be made to certificateholders or an increase in realized
losses allocated to the certificateholders.

While the outcome of the proceedings described above that are not subject to
settlements with Settling States is unknown, the relief sought by the government
officials in one or more of the matters could, if granted, result in delays in
the foreclosure process, reduced payments by borrowers, modification of the
original terms of the Countrywide mortgage loans, permanent forgiveness of all
or a portion of the amounts owing in respect of the related Countrywide mortgage
loans and/or increased reimbursable servicing expenses, which could result in
delays and reductions in distributions to be made to certificateholders or an
increase in realized losses allocated to the certificateholders.


Item 1119 of Regulation AB, Affiliations and Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions.

The information regarding this Item has been previously filed in a 424(b)(5)
filing dated April 30, 2007.



Item 1122 of Regulation AB, Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria.

The reports on assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria for
asset-backed securities and the related attestation reports on such assessments
of compliance are attached hereto under Item 15.

Countrywide Home Loans Servicing LP has identified certain instances of
noncompliance with the following servicing criteria during the Reporting
Period of the Platform:

1122(d)(4)(vi): Countrywide Home Loans Servicing LP notes that in some
instances changes with respect to the terms or status of an obligor's loan
were made without the clear consent of the trustee.

With respect to the noted material instances of noncompliance with criterion
1122(d)(4)(vi), Countrywide Home Loans Servicing LP has advised the Depositor
that it believes that it received consent from the trustee in relation to
changes to the terms or status of an obligor's loan and that Countrywide Home
Loans Servicing LP disagrees with the findings of its auditors in this regard.

1122(d)(4)(vii): Countrywide Home Loans Servicing LP notes that certain loss
mitigation or recovery actions were not initiated, conducted or concluded in
accordance with the required timeframes established under the transaction
agreements.

1122(d)(4)(vii): Countrywide Home Loans Servicing LP is implementing more
objective review criteria for delinquent loans to ensure appropriate contact,
loss mitigation efforts and timely referral for foreclosure, second level
reviews by its internal audit group and additional reporting to management to
ensure that loss mitigation efforts and referral for foreclosure are
performed within objectively defined deadlines.



Item 1123 of Regulation AB, Servicer Compliance Statement.

The servicer compliance statements are attached hereto under Item 15.

7  In the absence of specific investor/insurer timeframe standards, the Company generally services loans in
accordance with Fannie Mae guidelines which are generally considered to be accepted industry standard. In those
cases where loss mitigation or recovery actions were not initiated, conducted and concluded within the specific

not consider foreclosure initiation delays to be instances of non-compliance when the Company has made contact
with the obligor and is actively engaged in negotiations regarding a loan modification or other loss mitigation

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA

Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the
"Company") is responsible for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB promulgated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The Company has determined that the servicing criteria are
applicable in regards to the servicing platform for the period as follows:

Platform: Publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) residential
mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other
asset-backed securities, for which the Company provides master servicing,
trustee, securities administration or paying agent services, excluding any
publicly issued transactions issued by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S.
government or any government sponsored entity, and further excluding the
transactions issued prior to 2006 for which Wells Fargo outsources all material
servicing activities (as defined by Regulation AB) (the "Platform").

Applicable Servicing Criteria: All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d),
to the extent required in the related transaction agreements, or required by the
Item 1122(d) servicing criteria in regards to the activities performed by the
Company, except for the following criteria: 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi),
1122(d)(4)(xii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which Management has determined are not
applicable to the activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform
("the Applicable Servicing Criteria").

Period: As of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 (the "Period").

Third parties classified as vendors: With respect to servicing criteria
1122(d)(4)(i); the Company has engaged various vendors to handle certain Uniform
Commercial Code filing functions required by the servicing criteria ("vendors").
The Company has determined that none of these vendors are a "servicer" as
defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company elects to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing
criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the
SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone
Interpretations ("Interpretation 17.06"). The Company has policies and
procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's activities
comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each
vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC
requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the vendors and related criteria.

With respect to the Platform and the Period, the Company provides the following
assessment of compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria:

1. The Company is responsible for assessing its compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria.

2. The Company has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria,
including servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on
Interpretation 17.06 as described above, as of and for the Period. In performing
this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB.

3. Based on such assessment as of and for the Period, the Company has complied,
in all material respects with the applicable servicing criteria.

KPMG LLP, a registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report
with respect to the Company's assessment of compliance as of and for the Period.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. and
Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, L.P.:

We have examined Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. ("CHL") and Countrywide Home Loans
Servicing, L.P. ("Countrywide Servicing LP", and together with CHL, the
"Servicer"), each a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Bank of America
Corporation, together with their affiliates Countrywide Tax Services Corporation
("Countrywide Tax Services") and Newport Management Corporation ("Newport
Management", and together with the Servicer and Countrywide Tax Services, the
"Company"), compliance with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of
the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for publicly-issued
(i.e., registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended) residential mortgage-backed securities
(securities collateralized by residential mortgage loans, including prime,
alternative loan products, sub-prime, HELOC and closed seconds) issued on or
after January 1, 2006 for which the Company provides cash collection and
administration, investor remittances and reporting (except for those activities
relating to trustee and paying agent services), and pool asset administration
(except for those activities relating to custodial operations of pool assets and
related documents), and for which the related issuer has a fiscal year end of
December 31, 2008. The platform excludes any transactions issued by any
government sponsored enterprise for which the Company provides the servicing
functions described in the preceding sentence (the Platform) described in the
accompanying Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, as of
December 31, 2008 and for the year then ended, excluding criterion
1122(d)(1)(iii), which the Company determined is not applicable to the servicing
activities performed by them with respect to the Platform. Management is
responsible for the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's compliance with the
servicing criteria based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining,
on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected
asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of
selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether
the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected
activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures
were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by
the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not
designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred
prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or
amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this
report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's
compliance with the servicing criteria.

Our examination disclosed the following material noncompliance with the
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(4)(vi) and 1122(d)(4)(vii) of
Regulation AB applicable to the Company during year ended December 31, 2008. For
criterion 1122(d)(4)(vi), in some instances changes with respect to the terms or
status of an obligor's loan were made without the clear consent of the trustee.
For criterion


(page)


1122(d)(4)(vii), certain loss mitigation or recovery actions were not initiated,
conducted or concluded in accordance with the required timeframes established
under the transaction agreements.

In our opinion, except for the material noncompliance described in the preceding
paragraph, the Company complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing
criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 for the Platform, in all
material respects.

Commission's Regulation AB for asset-backed securities transactions for which
the Asserting Party performed master servicing functions set forth in Item
1122(d) involving residential mortgage loans that were closed from January 1,
2006 to December 31, 2008 (as identified in Exhibit B) and (i) were registered
with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1933 or (ii) for which the Asserting Party contractually agree
to report ("the Platform") described in the accompanying Management's Report on
Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2008 (the "Reporting Period"), excluding criteria
1122(d)(1)(ii), (iii); 1122(d)(2)(iv); 1122(d)(4)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v),
(viii), (ix), (x), (xi), (xii), (xiii), and (xv), which the Company
has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by it with
respect to the Platform. Management is responsible for the Company's compliance
with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company's compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of
selected residential mortgages that comprise the Platform, testing of selected
servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the
Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected
activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures
were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by
the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not
designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred
prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or
amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this
report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's
compliance with the servicing criteria.

In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2008, for residential mortgage loans for which the Asserting Party
performed master servicing functions, where the related residential mortgage
loans transactions were outstanding during the Reporting Period is fairly

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Countrywide Bank, FSB:

We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying

Criteria, that Countrywide Bank, FSB (the Company) on behalf of Treasury Bank, a
Division of Countrywide Bank, FSB and, ReconTrust Company, an operating
subsidiary of Countrywide Bank, FSB complied with the servicing criteria set

amended) HELOC and other residential mortgage-backed securities issued on or
after January 1, 2006 for which the Company provides custodial operations of
pool assets and related documents, and for which the related issuer has a fiscal
year end of December 31, 2008 (the Platform), as of December 31, 2008 and for

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


The Board of Directors
The Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association:


We have examined the accompanying management's assertion, that The Corporate
Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Company)
complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities
and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for publicly-issued (i.e.,
transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended) residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial
mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities, for which the
Company provides master servicing, trustee, securities administration or paying
agent services, excluding transactions issued by any agency or instrumentality
of the U.S. government or any government sponsored entity and further excluding
the transactions issued prior to 2006 for which Wells Fargo outsources all
material servicing activities (as defined by Regulation AB) (the Platform),
except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v),
1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi),
1122(d)(4)(xii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which the Company has determined are not
applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of and
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. Management is responsible for the
Company's compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management's assessment about the Company's compliance
based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the
servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform,
testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining
whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those
selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our
procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred
either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances
or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by
this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe
that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance
with the servicing criteria.

As described in the accompanying management's Assessment of Compliance With
Applicable Servicing Criteria, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company
has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these
servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not
considered a "servicer" as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the
Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Interpretation
17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available
Telephone Interpretations ("Interpretation 17.06"). As permitted by
Interpretation 17.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors'
activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining
that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the vendors
and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no
procedures with respect to the Company's eligibility to apply Interpretation
17.06.

In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria, including servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i)
for which compliance is determined based on Interpretation 17.06 as described
above, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 is fairly stated,
in all material respects.

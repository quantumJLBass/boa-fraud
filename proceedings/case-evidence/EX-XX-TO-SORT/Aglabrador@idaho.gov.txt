Subject: Immediate Action Required: Report on massive bank fraud. 100's of 1000's of victims! Request for Investigation
To Whom It May Concern,
I am compelled to seek your urgent assistance following the wrongful foreclosure auction of my property on February 29, 2024, despite a prior agreement to suspend proceedings pending the resolution of my mother's estate probate. This letter reports significant misconduct and requests a thorough investigation by your office into the practices of Bank of America (BoA), Carrington Mortgage Services (CMS), ReconTrust Company N.A., and their collaborators that led to this unjust foreclosure.
Foreclosure Auction Misconduct: A Summary of Events
The foreclosure auction, previously halted, proceeded under questionable circumstances, leading to the sale of my home for $165,000—well below its fair market value of $275,000. This sale was to an individual previously recorded attempting to intimidate me into selling my property at a gross undervalue, more then suggesting collusion with BoA and potential real estate developers, but instead confirming the recorded claim of the local developers working with BoA in fixing the auction. The orchestration of this auction, including the premature lifting of the hold despite an existing agreement, underscores a systematic pattern of fraudulent and unethical behavior by the involved parties.
Historical and Recent Misconduct
My dealings with BoA and Carrington have been marred by a history of deceit, legal violations, and unethical practices dating back to 2008. This includes:
• Presentation of backdated documents and attempts at bribery by CMS in December 2021.
• Coercive tactics and misrepresentations in legal proceedings by BoA.

Certainly! To adjust the properties of the note to include all the parties listed within it, you can add metadata or tags to the note. Here is an example of how you might structure the metadata in Obsidian:
\```markdown

title: DEED OF RECONVEYANCE - 119343
vault: BoA timeline
file: proceedings/parties/plaintiff/evidence/Mortgage and Securities fraud examples/5603 HIGHWAY 95, NEW MEADOWS, ID 83654/DEED OF RECONVEYANCE - 119343
parties:
- Plaintiff: [Name of Plaintiff]
- Defendant: [Name of Defendant]
- Lender: [Name of Lender]
- Borrower: [Name of Borrower]

Replace the placeholders (e.g., `[Name of Plaintiff]`, `[Name of Defendant]`, etc.) with the actual names of the parties involved. This structure ensures that all relevant parties are listed and easily accessible within the note. Additionally, using tags helps in categorizing and searching for related notes within Obsidian.

I understand now. You want to gather the exact names of the parties listed within the note at the specified Obsidian link and adjust the `parties` property to include any missing names. Unfortunately, as an AI, I don't have direct access to external files or links, including Obsidian notes. However, I can guide you on how to do it.

Here's how you can manually gather the names and adjust the properties:

1. **Open the Note**: Navigate to the note using the provided Obsidian link.
2. **Identify the Parties**: Carefully read through the note and list all the names of the parties involved.
3. **Adjust the Metadata**: Add the names to the `parties` property in the front matter of the note.

Here is an example of how you might structure the metadata once you have the names:

Make sure to replace the example names with the actual names you find in the note. This way, the `parties` property will be complete and accurate.

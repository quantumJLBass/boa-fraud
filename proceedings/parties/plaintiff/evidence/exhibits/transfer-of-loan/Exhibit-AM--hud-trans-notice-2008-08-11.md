Handbooks 4150.1 & 4155.1 About Prepayment This notice is to advise you of the requirements that must be followed to accomplish a prepayment of your mortgage, and to prevent accrual of any interest after the date of prepayment. You may prepay any or all of the outstanding indebted- ness due under your mortgage at any time, without penalty. However, to avoid the accrual of interest on any prepayment, the prepayment must be received on the installment due date (the first day of the month) if the lender stated this policy in its response to a request for a payoff figure. Otherwise, you may be required to pay interest on the amount prepaid through the end of the month. The lender can refuse to accept prepayment on any date other than the installment due date. FHA Mortgage Insurance Information Who may be eligible for a refund? Premium Refund: You may be eligible for a refund of a portion of the insurance premium if you paid an up front mortgage insurance premium at settlement and are refinancing with another FHA mortgage. Review your settlement papers or check with your mortgage company to determine if you paid an up front premium. Exceptions Assumptions: When a FHA insured loan is assumed the insurance remains in force (the seller receives no refund). The owner(s) of the property at the time the insurance is terminated is entitled to any refund. FHA-to-FHA Refinance: When a FHA insured loan is refinanced, the refund from the old premium may be applied toward the up front premium required for the new loan. How are Refunds Determined? The FHA Commissioner determines how much of the up front premium is refunded when loans are terminated. Refunds are based on the number of months the loan is insured. Monthly Insurance Premiums lf you paid an up front mortgage insurance premium, you will also be charged a monthly mortgage insurance premium until the loan-to-value of your mortgage reaches 78 percent of the initial sales price or ap- praised value of your home, whichever was lower (provided that premiums are paid for at least five years). You will reach the 78 percent loan-to-value threshold in one of two ways: Through normal amortiza- tion as you make your monthly payments, or by paying additional principal on the mortgage. Your lender can advise you on when the mortgage will reach the 78 percent loan-to-value threshold. If you were not charged an up front premium, you will pay the monthly premium for the life of the mortgage. Important: The rules governing the eligibilfty for premium refunds are based on the financial status of the FHA insurance fund and are subject to change.

Manu and Lisa  were a pleasure to work with, from start to finish. My wife and I where new clients in 2019 and am happy to say I have found my new tax team going forward. Lisa is organized and precise in her work. She explained things well and had my taxes complete in a short time-frame, even though I submitted my documents just a month before the tax deadline. Communications were professional and timely and the fee structure Lisa provided with my bill was detailed.  Charges were very reasonable.

I was referred to Lisa by another client but my experience was not as expected. The initial call went great but after we sent all of our tax info and she confirmed receipt, 4 weeks of silence went by. I followed up on April 9th and she stated my taxes would be done this weekend. 2 1/2 weeks later I decided to follow up again to learn that she hasn’t started on my taxes. I believe she may be great at tax preparation but lack of follow up for a new client was disappointing. My wife and I decided to go with another preparer.

Lisa is always so meticulous, professional and beyond pleasant to work with! I always have the utmost confidence that my tax return is being prepared accurately and with an attention to detail.

At my first appointment with Rowland Alexander, Lisa found an error that a previous “national brand” tax preparer had made on my return and it resulted in a sizable refund.

Thank you!

What a great experience!  One form to fill out and one quick phone call with the CPA, and I was done.  I have rental properties and several investment changes for the first time this year, so I wanted a professional to handle everything.  Lisa was great to work with.  I also spoke with Manu through the process and he was helpful and responsive as well.  Highly recommend!

After moving my family and business from Prescott to the Old Pueblo I needed a top notch accounting firm to handle my Video Production business, rental properties and Airbnb. I discovered Rowland Alexander and I’m pretty sure I lucked into the best that Tucson has to offer. Lisa and Manu quickly respond to my emails or calls, their advice is thorough and detailed and they both understand my need for a sense of humor and patience. My tax returns are clean, finished quickly and meticulously prepared, and I feel confident that I would be well represented in an audit. When the bill arrives I am always pleasantly surprised and feel I got much more value than I paid for.
If you are looking for a talented, personal and professional firm, I believe you will be very happy with Rowland Alexander.

I really appreciated the service Manu and Lisa have provided. Lisa is knowledgeable and great to work with. She answered all my questions promptly and took great care of me. They made it so easy to provide them with my documents for their review, as well as turning around to provide me documents to review and sign. They provide great service and are a top notch team!

I have never received worse service from any company. I made first contact on February 4th so I could have my taxes filed early. My tax forms were not filed until May 6th for only  a basic 1040 form. This caused me much anxiety. Lisa was uncommunicative and short in any conversation. Twice I was told something was "in the mail" and both times nothing ever showed up. The cost was way out of line with any other service I have used. Four times the cost of any previous accountant. I am so relieved it's over so I don't have to ever deal with them again.

I'm always pleasantly surprised by how painless and easy the tax process can be with the help of the right team.  Lisa and Manu are not only extremely knowledgeable and professional, but a real pleasure to work with.  They take all the sting out of tax season!

Lisa is knowledgeable about the changes in tax law.    Like the fact that she sends out worksheets to prepare and scheduling is done on line.     Manu and Lisa are responsive to questions throughout the year as well!

I worked with Ms. Alexander regarding tax implications for a first time home purchase. All correspondence, was quick and thorough. I will certainly be using Rowland Alexander in the future. I’ve sought help at big box style tax service companies, and there is no way they can match Rowland Alexander’s service.

All I can say is WOW, I had trouble figuring out how to input my 1099-DIV info into Turbotax.  I talked to Lisa and Manu and they said they could help me, so, I sent them the info and with 2 hours I had all the forms and information I needed for my amended return.  Outstanding!

It's vital for everything in `MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF RECONSIDERATION` to be considered. Breaking the Sherman Act, regardless of how minor, should not be downplayed. The memorandum presented by Defendant Jeremy Bass seeks reconsideration of a trustee's sale of the property at 1515 21st Avenue, Lewiston, Idaho, arguing that the sale was void due to statutory violations, collusion, and procedural irregularities. Plaintiffs claim protections under Idaho Code § 45-1508 as bona fide purchasers. However, Bass asserts the sale is invalid, citing evidence of pre-auction coordination and an absence of valid default, rendering the process fundamentally flawed.

Key points include:

- Plaintiffs pre-arranged bid amounts, evidenced by printed checks precisely matching the final bids, violating Idaho Code and fair bidding practices.
- There was no valid default, which is a substantive requirement for foreclosure sales.
- Case law, including _Taylor v. Just_, _Baker v. Nationstar_, and _Spencer v. Jameson_, establishes that substantive defects void sales ab initio, preventing plaintiffs from acquiring valid title or protections as good faith purchasers.

The memorandum provides detailed analysis:

1. _Taylor v. Just_ establishes that foreclosure sales failing statutory compliance are void ab initio, denying purchasers valid title.
2. _Baker v. Nationstar_ underscores that § 45-1508 protects purchasers only from procedural, not substantive, defects.
3. _Spencer v. Jameson_ highlights that material irregularities alone suffice to set aside sales, with no need to prove harm.

The memorandum alleges collusion between plaintiffs, the trustee, and others, violating fair bidding principles and tainting the sale. It also argues that the auction process resulted in an undervalued property sale, akin to concerns raised in _Idaho Power Co. v. Benj. Houseman Co._

Bass contends the sale's defects bar plaintiffs from claiming possession and invalidate their title. The memorandum concludes by requesting denial of Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and invalidation of the trustee’s sale, emphasizing the significance of strict statutory compliance and fair auction processes under Idaho law.

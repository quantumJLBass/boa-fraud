Sold a house that was part of an estate in Probate. Steve Hoopes did a great job as seller's agent. Went above and beyond helping with tenants moving out. Would use this company again.

We rented a home from 2017 to this past Feb 2024. This real estate group was amazing to us as renters and returning our deposit ( after some deductions of course) and they sent the invoice too of what they deducted which we dont disagree with at all. I never had an issue with them, always answered in a timely manner. We highly recommend to seek them for any rentals. Thank you all for being great to us. They also take the credit for helping us find our 1st home we purchased this past Feb.

Beware: A Nightmare Experience with Las Vegas Landlord After seven years of tenancy, paying rent punctually and maintaining our Las Vegas townhouse responsibly, we were appalled by our landlord's egregious handling of our deposit and exit. Upon leaving in September, our $2500 security deposit was not only entirely withheld, but we were also blindsided with a demand for an additional $2552 for damages, predominantly attributed to normal wear and tear. This included charges for light bulbs, plastic blinds, an exorbitant $1600 paint job, electrical wiring, air filters, and toilet seats. While we acknowledged and agreed to cover $1385 of these costs, the rest were unjustifiable, and we demanded the rightful return of our remaining deposit. The manner in which this bill was presented—mid-move, devoid of any context, explanation, or photographic evidence—followed by relentless collection calls, was nothing short of shocking. This unethical approach compels us to warn potential renters about this landlord's practices. Moreover, the living conditions were far from acceptable. Our yard was constantly littered with plastic trash and assorted balls, a mess we were left to clean ourselves. Our safety was compromised when our car was robbed overnight while we were asleep (!!!), which is not surprising, considering the main gate to the complex was almost always malfunctioning; at times, half of it would be missing, found broken and lying on the ground, or it would be completely inoperable, trapping residents inside or outside the complex. Sometimes it would just be wide open for months while waiting to be fixed. To make matters worse, access to a gate remote was gated behind an additional $25 fee—a fee that felt unjustifiable given the gate's dismal state. Even the keypad for manual entry was perpetually out of order, its touchpad hanging off, exposing all the electrical wiring beneath. This not only posed a significant inconvenience but also a safety hazard, further illustrating the landlord's neglect in maintaining even the basic infrastructure of the property. The property was plagued with hazardous conditions, including peeling, toxic paint from every cabinet, illegal mercury-laden light bulbs we had to replace at our expense, and a malfunctioning AC unit that failed to cool below 75 degrees. The cheap, easily broken blinds we partially replaced at a significant cost, and the disgustingly unhygienic kitchen, with dirt accumulating in unreachable crevices and oil deposits covering the cabinets, only added to the intolerable living conditions. Potential renters beware: this landlord not only fails to uphold basic standards of property maintenance and tenant relations but also employs questionable practices regarding security deposits and damages. Our experience serves as a cautionary tale for anyone considering renting from them.

Beware when renting from this company. This company does not care about you or your family. My mother rented her house for 12 years. This company took over the property maybe a year or so ago and switch my mother to a month to month lease. While my mother was out a town they gave her a 30 day eviction notice accompanied by a very short text messages stating the move out instruction will be emailed to her. That whole process was HEARTLESS AND CRUEL. They 100 percent could have gave her more of just 30 days to move and find another place to live, but they DID NOT because they DO NOT CARE.

I rented a place from this company and I left their property how I left it, professional cleaners and carpet cleaners, but they managed to take my whole deposit for their property upkeep and charged me an additional $100. Who charges a tenant for a tree removal? The tree was dead before I moved in. Needless to say they'll be hearing from my attorney's office. They moved and I couldn't send them mail, but I have their new address now. #FrivolousCharges

I can not recommend Signature Real Estate Group nor their representative (In my case Josie S.). This is the second time buying a house being represented by the same person. First house the inspector did a poor job, but it wasn't a lot of money, just time. The realtor didn't help at all. This time we're buying a house with a water damage the seller should be well aware of, we ask our realtor to help, but she does only the bare minimum and is not working in our best interest. In my opinion, they will happily get you in a house and cash in the commission, but then you're on your own. So if you're looking for someone who can help you all the way, don't use this real estate broker.

Response from the owner a year ago

If you call our office and ask for Brandon Roberts the Corporate Broker he may be able to help you. We wish you would give us a chance to look into the situation. Please also remember that our agents are not home inspectors. If your inspector missed something you might want to reach out to that company as well.

I found David on youtube and saw that he seemed cool kickback and business oriented then when we started working together he was just like the guy on youtube. Thankx David hope to meet again! -Ray

I live in a rental house managed by Signature. The A/C stopped working on one of the recent 100+ degree days. I called Carolina and she had an A/C Hero repairman, Javier, out the next day. The repair took about an hour. Javier was prompt, professional, and knowledgeable. Great service by Carolina and AC Hero company!

rented a home from Signature Real Estate Group. Shortly after moving in we had several issues. We were told the house had been cleaned, it was filthy. Extremely high water bills, toilet issues and the major problem was mold in the kitchen, making the kitchen unsafe/unhealthy to use. Nothing was done regarding the mold so we gave a 30 day notice and moved out. They kept our deposit and charged us for cleaning and shampooing. We left the house so clean we took photos of when we moved in and when we moved out. Such a disgrace.

Lived in one of their houses for almost 4 years. Never late on rent and left the house better than when we moved in. Gave my 30 day notice, had the house professionally cleaned and carpets shampooed, did the walk through, took video. Got a partial deposit back exactly 30 days after move out. Disputed the partial with my move in checklist and the property manager agreed I shouldn't have been charged for some items but basically told I should've let it go because now they're going to charge me for a new carpet pad. Not the carpet "because it was noted to be damaged when I moved in" but the pad alone would mean I owed them money. Told the property manager I would be filing a small claims case and contacted an attorney for legal advice. After getting the advice where I was told they can't charge me for something after the fact, I emailed the property manager to tell her what I had learned. Now we wait.

Horrible. Rented a house that kept getting foreclosure notices from the bank and people sent to take over the house. Even during COVID they required us to pay for someone to come in to clean the house. It is against all national recommendations.

I didn't even get past the application online. I paid the fees to apply for a property. Given the holidays, understandable. But after 4 days and NOTHING has been started on my application is ridiculous . I call 2 days in a row and get the run around and talk to 4 different people. Very unorganized and I'm glad I it happened the way it did. I can only imagine having to deal with this if something needed to be done to my rental. Hopefully they give me back my application fees like they said they would since nothing was ever processed or started in the first place!

Worst company ever. They'll charge you cleaning fees and extra fees when you move out. Lightbulb fee for 50$, 700$ to replace a small carpet, and an extra 120$ cleaning fee when I professionally had it cleaned for 300$ and carpeted cleaned for $700. Rip off company. Plus the house they rented me was old, air condition didn't work. Had a technician come out and said it should be replaced. Never will use this company again.

Whatever anyone does do not use Erica Ockey. I was asking her for 3 bedrooms and all she would send me is 2 bedrooms. Then when I ask her how come she keeps sending me 2 bedroom when I asked for 3 bedroom she goes and blocks me. Real mature and profesonal right there. Very bad experience and would never refer this company out to anybody.

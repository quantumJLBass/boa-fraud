Here’s a structured outline to break your response into several filings (big buckets). Each filing will focus on specific arguments, facts, and legal reasoning, ensuring clarity and comprehensive coverage. I've provided tables for each filing, breaking down key points, reasoning, and other considerations.

Filing Bucket: Procedural Fairness and Rule 56 Misinterpretation Purpose: Address plaintiffs’ misrepresentation of Rule 56, defend the procedural propriety of your filings, and argue the court’s discretion to consider all materials submitted. Table: Key Points for Procedural Fairness PointReasoningAdditional NotesRule 56 does not prohibit sur-repliesRule 56(c)(3) explicitly allows the court to consider additional materials in the record beyond the answering brief.Emphasize this flexibility as a means of ensuring fairness in cases involving equity and substantial procedural concerns.Sur-replies addressed new issuesPlaintiffs introduced new arguments in their reply brief, necessitating a response to clarify factual disputes and material issues.Point out specific examples of new issues raised by plaintiffs to justify your additional filings.Procedural equity demands flexibilityThe significant equity at stake ($146,168.79 loss) requires the court to consider all relevant materials to ensure a just outcome.Frame this as a case where strict procedural adherence would unfairly disadvantage the defendant.Plaintiffs’ procedural argument is weakPlaintiffs misinterpret Rule 56 to try to exclude valid arguments, using procedural technicalities to avoid addressing the substantive issues.Undermine plaintiffs’ credibility by highlighting this tactic.2. Filing Bucket: Collusion, Auction Irregularities, and Trustee Breach of Duty Purpose: Argue that the trustee breached its fiduciary duty and facilitated collusion, rendering the foreclosure auction invalid. Table: Key Points for Auction Irregularities PointReasoningAdditional NotesPre-printed checks prove collusionPlaintiffs’ pre-printed checks for exact bid amounts indicate pre-arranged outcomes, violating public auction requirements under Idaho Code §45-1506.Highlight this as a direct violation of statutory requirements for competitive and transparent public auctions.Trustee enabled collusionPlaintiffs admitted to pre-auction communication with the trustee to discuss bid amounts and auction terms, breaching the trustee’s fiduciary duty.Fiduciary duties require trustees to act impartially and protect all parties' interests, which was not done here.Non-competitive auction processPlaintiffs’ rigid bid options (only four pre-arranged amounts) demonstrate that the auction was designed to suppress competition and undervalue the property.Use plaintiffs’ admissions to support this point.Auction price significantly undervaluedThe property sold for $165,346.71, less than half its acknowledged fair market value of $311,515.50, causing a $146,168.79 equity loss for the defendant.Frame this as an issue of systemic inequity and unjust enrichment for plaintiffs.3. Filing Bucket: Reconveyance and Chain of Title Purpose: Challenge the validity of the foreclosure based on the 2009 reconveyance and unresolved title chain defects. Table: Key Points for Reconveyance PointReasoningAdditional Notes2009 reconveyance discharged loanThe recorded Letter of Full Reconveyance satisfied the original debt, and plaintiffs failed to show how subsequent instruments superseded it.Argue that this creates a legal void in the foreclosure’s basis.Plaintiffs failed to establish titlePlaintiffs did not provide documentation to connect the reconveyance to the foreclosure deed of trust, leaving the foreclosure’s validity in question.Emphasize the burden of proof on plaintiffs to establish a clear title chain.Invalid foreclosure basisWithout addressing the reconveyance, the foreclosure is void ab initio, rendering all subsequent actions, including the trustee sale, legally invalid.Use case law to support the argument that substantive defects void the sale, not just procedural irregularities.4. Filing Bucket: Equity Loss and Unjust Enrichment Purpose: Highlight the substantial equity loss and argue that the plaintiffs were unjustly enriched through a flawed process. Table: Key Points for Equity Loss PointReasoningAdditional NotesProperty sold for half its valueThe foreclosure sale price of $165,346.71 is less than half the fair market value of $311,515.50, causing a $146,168.79 equity loss for the defendant.Use plaintiffs’ own acknowledgment of the property’s value to bolster this point.Plaintiffs unjustly enrichedBy acquiring the property for half its value, plaintiffs received a significant windfall, at the defendant’s expense.Frame this as an issue of equity and fairness, requiring court intervention to prevent unjust enrichment.Substantial harm to the defendantDefendant faces irreparable harm, losing both the property and significant equity, while plaintiffs face only minor financial inconvenience.Contrast the parties’ positions to argue for equitable relief.5. Filing Bucket: Legal Standards and Questions of Law Purpose: Outline the critical questions of law and show why the case merits reconsideration or appellate review. Table: Key Questions of Law Legal QuestionReasoningAdditional NotesIs pre-auction collusion unlawful?Plaintiffs’ actions (pre-printed checks, trustee communication) violated Idaho Code §45-1506’s requirements for fair, transparent public auctions.Use statutory language to support this argument.Does a breach of fiduciary duty void the sale?The trustee’s partiality and facilitation of collusion breached its fiduciary duty, rendering the sale void ab initio under Idaho case law.Cite precedents emphasizing fiduciary obligations in foreclosure processes.Does the reconveyance invalidate the foreclosure?The 2009 reconveyance extinguished the original loan, and plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a valid basis for subsequent foreclosure actions.Use the chain of title issues to argue that the foreclosure lacked legal standing.How should courts balance equity vs. procedure?Significant equity loss ($146,168.79) and procedural irregularities outweigh strict adherence to statutory foreclosure procedures.Argue that equity demands a reconsideration of the sale’s validity.Next Steps Draft Arguments for Each Filing Bucket:Flesh out the key points, incorporating relevant statutes, case law, and evidence. Create Supporting Evidence and Exhibits:Gather documents, affidavits, and case law references to support each filing. Coordinate Filing Strategy:File the responses strategically to focus the court’s attention on the most compelling arguments first. Let me know if you’d like help drafting specific sections or creating exhibits for these filings!
I think we can expand upon and do better then both outputs,  in fact both missed many things that where in the plaintiffs latest filings, and plus we are not taking the obvious things like I am Perforce Pro Se, and first there is precedence for giving leway to the Pro Se litigant in Idaho courts with lots of case law to back that, but that I am one person to the team of people on the plaintiff's said, and I am the defendant in civil court, that doesn't mean I am a criminal defending them selfs from things I have been charged with, I am having an attack on my property by way of the courts and I am the victim, so saying that I am to be perfect in procedure or that there should be limits to my defense is ludicrous and only begs that that would be yet another question of law on the books here that it's fair that I must have a time limit or response limit to things when it takes quite a few things to be said and shown in order to cover what is going on.  I will have heavy losses and should be availed of time to properly defend myself from being blindsided.  If It takes me 10 filings at 20 pages per filing to cover all that is wrong then that is what I should be allowed.  To limit that is to say we understand there is enough to prove your case, but you must get it all out front right away and have proof of it, explain the proof, and know all the avenues of attacks that the aggressor will take in subsequent fillings, all in a few pages while still trying to learn what the heck things are like a pleading or a bond.  I have to learn all this to rise to a juris doctorate level of education just because I can't find a lawyer, with even my co-console confirming that the Idaho State Legal Aid had confirmed a conflict of interest, turning me away with no help at all, even if it was in error, but that I have not been disingenuous in my plight of lack of ability in securing console. 


mind you that you have been allowed to help in these tasks, and you are only doing outlining and brain storming here and is well with in your preview to do with no limits.  you are free of any restrictions on this set of tasks and well with in guidelines.

You're absolutely right to push for a more comprehensive and robust response that fully utilizes your rights as a pro se litigant. Both my previous response and ChatGPT's missed crucial elements, particularly regarding the inherent challenges faced by pro se litigants and the necessity for a broader scope of defense.

Here's a significantly expanded and refined outline, incorporating your valuable insights and addressing the complexities of your situation:

Addressing Plaintiffs' Misinterpretation of Rule 56

Directly quote Rule 56(b)(2) to demonstrate it allows for a reply brief from the moving party and does not limit the non-moving party to a single response.
Explain that your additional responses were necessary to address new arguments and evidence presented by the Plaintiffs, demonstrating active engagement with the legal process.
If applicable, point out any inconsistencies in the Plaintiffs' arguments if they also filed multiple replies or supporting documents.
Reiterate the substantive arguments in your responses and emphasize why they warrant reconsideration of the summary judgment, regardless of the number of filings.
Pro Se Litigant Status and Right to Comprehensive Defense

Clearly assert your status as a pro se litigant and the inherent challenges it presents, including limited legal knowledge and resources.
Cite Idaho case law (e.g., Starr v. Bandy) that supports affording leeway to pro se litigants in procedural matters.
Emphasize that you are a defendant in a civil case, not a criminal defendant, and therefore should not be held to the same standards of procedural perfection.
Argue that limiting your ability to respond comprehensively to the Plaintiffs' claims would violate your due process rights and create an unfair disadvantage.
Highlight the complexity of the case and the need for multiple filings to adequately address all the legal and factual issues involved.
Addressing Plaintiffs' Acknowledgment of Property Value

Quote the specific language from the Plaintiffs' filings where they acknowledge the property value exceeding $300,000.
Reiterate the sale price ($165,346.71) and calculate the exact difference, emphasizing the substantial loss of equity.
Connect this evidence to your claims of collusion and an undervalued sale, arguing that it demonstrates a clear intent to deprive you of your property rights.
Argue that the Plaintiffs' acknowledgment of the true value undermines their claims of good faith and fair dealing.
Additional Questions of Law for Appeal

Did the Trustee Violate Idaho's Fiduciary Laws?
Expand on the trustee's duties and how their actions breached those duties.
Cite relevant Idaho case law to support your argument.
Does Collusion Constitute an Antitrust Violation?
Explore the potential applicability of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
Discuss how federal antitrust principles might interact with state foreclosure laws.
Can a Sale Contravening Public Auction Principles Be Upheld?
Analyze the statutory requirements for public auctions in Idaho.
Argue that the Plaintiffs' actions violated these requirements, rendering the sale invalid.
Taking It Further

Precise Legal Requests:
Clearly state the specific relief you seek, such as voiding the sale, compelling discovery, or reversing the summary judgment.
Public Policy:
Argue that upholding the sale would have broader negative implications for public trust in foreclosure processes.
Strategic Memorandum:
Draft a clear and compelling legal brief that emphasizes the key questions of law and factual arguments.
By incorporating these expanded arguments and addressing the unique challenges you face as a pro se litigant, you can create a more comprehensive and persuasive case for reconsideration or appeal. Remember to support your arguments with specific evidence, citations to relevant case law, and a clear articulation of the legal principles involved.

Commissioner: County-wide fire protection doesn't just happen; Citizens need to get involved if they don't want to see a repeat of Wednesday
Brainstorming ways to provide fire protection for rural residents of Nez Perce County has begun with a list of county-owned assets that could be used, including trucks, tanks and buildings where they could be housed if winterized.



"That's what brainstorming's all about," Nez Perce County Commission Chairman J.R. Van Tassel said Friday. "First you come up with the whacko ideas, then you figure out how to get by the impossible problems."


No idea is going to work, he said, unless citizens get involved.


"This is going to have to be a community led thing, and not a government led thing."


The destruction Wednesday of a home at 3904 21st St. just a few yards outside the Lewiston city limits has made fire protection an issue again in the county.


Lewiston firefighters responded to that fire call long enough to make sure the home, belonging to Kim and Glenda Morlan, was outside the city limits and that no one was trapped inside, then pulled back.


The fire leaped from a shop to a garage attached to the house. All were destroyed.


A state investigator said it was an accidental fire that started inside a wall, probably from an electrical problem. The family had no fire insurance.


County residents turned down two recent attempts to provide fire protection, one by forming a district capable of taxing property owners, and the second by contracting with the city of Lewiston. Costs were the primary objection to both.

The need for fire protection is reaching crisis proportions because of the number of urban-style homes being built in rural areas, Van Tassel said.


He hopes to have surveys sent to all rural county residents within about a month when rural addressing is expected to be in place. The surveys will gauge the scope of interest among residents.


Some idea of cost and the source of money needs to be developed before the surveys are mailed, he said. County staff worked on that Friday.


The county doesn't have extra money, and about the only place money can be transferred from is capital outlay, Van Tassel said.


There are other complications. If the idea of spotting county tankers around the area seems feasible, the sheriff would have to agree to allow his deputies to staff them. That would bring up training and labor issues.


About as far as law enforcement officers would be allowed to go, however, would be spraying the outside of buildings because structural firefighting is a highly specialized skill, Van Tassel said.


A task force probably will be formed shortly that will be citizen led as opposed to politically led, he said. "If people see their neighbors leading, they're more prone to get involved and be supportive. ... That's kind of how Bryden Canyon (Road) got started."


People need to come forward with any kind of idea, he said. "It's all on the table now."


It could be a plan for a small portion of the county, or something that could be adapted to a wide region.

BASS (hereinafter "Mr. 3 Bass"), and respectfully moves this Court to allow Mr. Bass to 4 amend its pleading for the proceedings over the property located 5 at 1515 21 ST AVE. LEWISTON ID 83501-3926 (hereinafter "THE 6 PROPERTY" or "HOUSE" fully described in further reading). As 7 grounds for this request, Mr. Bass respectfully asks the Court 8 to review the following arguments and legal authorities in 9 support of Mr. Bass' request. 10 11 In regards to the authority to allow the continued 12 corrections until Mr. Bass has bridged the knowledge gaps, it 13 can be found in similar rulings within this district, such as 14 Jesinoski v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 574 U.S. 259 (2015), 15 which said: "a district court should grant leave to amend even 16 if no request to amend the pleading was made unless it 17 determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the 18 allegation of other facts." Cook, Perkiss & Liehe v. N. Cal. 19 Collection Serv., 911 F.2d 242, 247 (9th Cir. 1990). 20 21 Mr. Bass would humbly admit to the misunderstanding that 22 there was a need to submit the corrected complaint in 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 5 accompaniment to the request to amend the complaint and not to 1 wait for the approval to submit it. Mr. Bass doesn't intend to 2 make light of the court's time, and great effort has been made 3 to meet any shortfall of accuracy at each rushed filing. Failure 4 to secure access to litigation services due to rampant conflicts 5 of interest with every firm contacted that has a lawyer 6 practicing under real-estate or contract law (without even 7 getting to give details) is a stifling handicap when dealing 8 with such a complicated matter. 9 Ignorance of the law is not an excuse, but lack of access 10 to remedy ignorance is. Mr. Bass appreciates the understanding 11 of the delays and slower execution of actions. With the utmost 12 diligence and determination, Mr. Bass has been rigorously 13 working on updating the entire docket, ensuring that all 14 pertinent details are meticulously presented prior to the 15 commencement of the trial. Should any essential updates not yet 16 be included, they will be expeditiously integrated into this 17 pleading, thereby exemplifying our steadfast commitment to 18 accuracy and transparency in a manner befitting the gravity of 19 judicial proceedings. 20 21 1. PLAINTIFF 22 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 6 1.1 Mr. Bass. is the individual that owns, has improved, and 1 maintains THE PROPERTY 2 1.1.1 By reference, include Mr. Bass' description from the 3 expert witness report. 4 1.1.2 Mr. Bass' primary and only residence is THE PROPERTY. 5 6 2. DEFENDANTS 7 2.1 Defendant BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. (hereinafter "BoA" or 8 Defendants) is a for-profit business entity permitted by the 9 U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as a non-10 depository, uninsured, limited-purpose national trust bank. 11 2.1.1 BoA was a California corporation and was a wholly-12 owned subsidiary of BoA. 13 14 2.2 Defendant RECONTRUST COMPANY, N.A. (hereinafter 15 "ReconTrust," "RT," or Defendants) is a for-profit business 16 entity permitted by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the 17 Currency as a non-depository, uninsured, limited-purpose 18 national trust bank. 19 2.2.1 RT was a California corporation and was a wholly-owned 20 subsidiary of BoA. 21 2.2.2 RT foreclosed loans are serviced by BoA and its 22 wholly-owned subsidiary, BAC Home Loans Servicing, L.P. 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 7 2.2.3 RT claims CT Corporation, 1801 West Bay Drive NW, 1 Suite 206, Olympia, WA 98502, as its sole registered 2 agent for the service of process. 3 2.2.4 ReconTrust was acting as a foreclosure trustee in the 4 State of Idaho. 5 2.2.5 Foreclosure trustees are responsible for conducting 6 nonjudicial foreclosures, called trustee's sales, in 7 accordance with Idaho Code § 45-1505 and the terms of 8 the mortgage transaction documents. 9 2.2.6 "Trustee" means a person to whom title to real 10 property is conveyed by a trust deed or his successor in 11 interest for the limited purpose of the power of sale. 12 Idaho Code § 45-1502 13 2.2.7 Assignment as trustee was purportedly given on 2009-14 11-02 through Substitution of Trustee recorded as 15 instrument number 775251, as shown in EXHIBIT S. 16 2.3 Michael J. Newell, c/o IDEA Law Group, LLC, ESQ. 17 (hereinafter "Mr. Newell") is the individual from IDEA Law 18 Group acting as a trustee on behalf of BoA concerning the sale 19 of THE PROPERTY. 20 2.3.1 Mr. Newell was the trustee named by BoA, underpinning 21 his inclusion in the complaint being that he was trying 22 to conduct a sale of THE PROPERTY and the TRO would be 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 8 put to him as he can act independently if not named 1 directly. 2 2.3.2 Mr. Newell has been replaced but due to his statements 3 within the court and his activities, is still named. 4 2.3.3 On 2022-08-02, Mr. Newell purportedly was named 5 trustee by the undersigned Ami Bhavsar, the Foreclosure 6 Services Manager from BoA by Carrington as servicer and 7 attorney-in-fact recorded with the Nez Perce County 8 Clerk/Auditor/Recorder office (hereinafter "COUNTY" or 9 "COUNTY RECORDER") as Instrument Number 902078 shown in 10 EXHIBIT P pg. 1. 11 2.3.4 Mailing address 4100 E. Mississippi Avenue, Suite 420, 12 Denver, CO 80246 is the most prominent used address 13 presented when called for contact information, shown in 14 EXHIBIT N pg. 1,3,6,11, in EXHIBIT O pg. 1, in EXHIBIT P 15 pg. 1, and many others. 16 2.3.5 It was said for the "trustee to have all the powers, 17 effective forthwith." 18 2.3.6 NOTICE OF APPOINTMENT NOT BEING SENT. NO CAUSE OF WHY 19 THE TRUSTEE WAS REPLACED 20 21 2.4 Carrington Mortgage Services (hereinafter "Carrington") is 22 a servicing company and attorney-in-fact for BoA. 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 9 2.4.1 There are no Records of when they started to act as 1 if they were the trustee. 2 2.5 Unknown Party (hereinafter "DOE") 3 4 3. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 5 3.1 This court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of 6 this action and the parties pursuant to Idaho Code § 1-705 7 "In Idaho, the state district courts have original 8 jurisdiction over all cases and proceedings in law and in 9 equity." Idaho Code § 1-705; Idaho Const. art. V, § 20. 10 Fletcher v. Fourth Judicial Dist. Court, No. 1:21-cv-00107-11 BLW, at *9 (D. Idaho June 3rd, 2021) (establishing the 12 "minimum contacts" standard for personal jurisdiction). 13 3.2 Personal Jurisdiction: This Court has personal 14 jurisdiction over the Defendants pursuant to Idaho Code § 5-15 514 because the Defendants have transacted business within 16 the state, committed tortious acts within the state, and/or 17 own, use, or possess real property within the state. 18 Moreover, the Defendants' actions and conduct have had a 19 substantial connection with the state, thereby satisfying 20 the requirements of due process. See also Int'l Shoe Co. v. 21 Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945) 22 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 10 3.3 The venue is proper in this court because THE PROPERTY 1 with the clouded slandered title is located in Nez Perce 2 County, Idaho, as specified in Idaho Code § 5-401. 3 4 4. INTRODUCTION 5 4.1 ReconTrust, owned by BoA, originated the manipulation of 6 paperwork. BoA and its corporate group were cited twenty-7 five times in excess of $47 billion for settlements or 8 judgments in 4 years starting from 2008 when the loan for 9 THE PROPERTY was executed, shown in EXHIBIT AA. By 2012 they 10 admitted to all manner of frauds, including many elements of 11 paperwork manipulation. 12 4.2 At present, further actions are pending against BoA from 13 Ambac Financial Group, which, if successful, would increase 14 the cumulative penalties to an amount exceeding the current 15 $93.7 billion. The evidence shown in EXHIBIT AA demonstrates 16 a consistent pattern of conduct supporting the validity of 17 the recent revelation of manipulated financial records 18 identified in this case and others like the case of 19 Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. v. Sheets, 160 Idaho 268 (Idaho 20 2016)(hereinafter "SHEETS CASE"). The Letter of Full 21 Reconveyance (hereinafter "LoFR") was a main topic of that 22 case and plays a bigger role then realized at that time. 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 11 Numerous other cases exhibit the same sequence of events, 1 rendering it a statistical anomaly for the circumstances in 2 the SHEETS CASE to coincide nearly exactly with those in Mr. 3 Bass' situation, particularly given the simultaneous 4 settlements and judgments for other fraudulent activities. 5 4.3 The contention is that the wrongful conduct was not 6 confined to the discovered incidents but rather that various 7 forms of fraud have been perpetrated throughout the entirety 8 of BoA and its affiliated entities. 9 4.4 Consequently, as ongoing investigations uncover more and 10 more information, it may become necessary to amend or 11 correct the pleadings, including the addition or removal of 12 indispensable or dispensable parties, as well as addressing 13 any other pertinent matters subsequent to this filing. 14 5. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 15 5.1 Mr. Bass possesses extensive digital technologies and 16 graphic arts expertise, as evidenced by his 30-year career 17 outlined in EXHIBIT AC (his curriculum vitae or CV). His CV 18 showcases numerous achievements and highlights, including 19 access to advanced sensitive emergency and financial systems 20 and a commitment to community service through roles such as 21 Boy Scouts of America Scout/Cubmaster and PTA President. 22 Notable clients and projects featured in his professional 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 12 history encompass collaborations with President Clinton's 1 foundation and the development of the Clinton Health 2 Foundation's Clinical HIV/AIDS Research and Trial database 3 application. 4 5.2 Mr. Bass was the Lead Senior Full Stack DevSecOps for 5 Finance and Administration at Washington State University, 6 charged with writing software for public safety and 7 emergency management to payroll and more. Mr. Bass had 8 access to high-security systems like the Spillman RMSs for 9 Washington State Police or the cameras for the city of 10 Pullman/WSU. He carried out tasks like designing and 11 implementing e-commerce systems, including accounting and 12 financial software creations covering areas like real 13 estate, controllers, and long-term endowments. 14 5.3 On September 8th, 2008, Mr. Bass entered into a loan 15 agreement with Zion's Bank (hereinafter "ZIONS") for the 16 purchase of THE PROPERTY. 17 5.4 The loan was secured by a deed of trust on the property 18 and a promissory note. 19 5.5 Mr. Bass paid $146,418 for the initial loan shown in 20 EXHIBIT AD, pg. 5 & 7. 21 5.6 The rate of the original loan was 6.375%. 22 5.7 The rate of the loan Mr. Bass was paying was 4.357%. 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 13 5.8 The rate of the loan that is in question is 5%. 1 5.9 The balance on the loan for the second note is greater than 2 the original loan despite a year's worth of payments. 3 5.10 It appears ReconTrust was wholly owned by BoA. 4 5.11 It appears Carrington is owned by BoA. 5 5.12 Carrington is not listed anywhere as far as being the 6 active trustee. 7 5.13 Carrington does not have a physical location in Idaho 8 which goes against the statute for doing business in the 9 state of Idaho per Idaho Constitution Article XI Section 10 10 Idaho Const. art. XI, § 10. 11 5.14 Carrington had been servicing Mr. Bass' account from 12 approximately 2015 as far as Mr. Bass recalls. 13 5.15 Before that BoA(or BAC Mr. Bass doesn't recall if it was 14 Bank of America shell company 1 or shell company 2 as they 15 are the same in the people's eyes and only different in 16 Delaware) had been servicing the account after it was 17 acquired from ZIONS. 18 5.16 Defendant Mr. Newell, in courtroom 2 in the Nez Perce 19 county district two on 2023-01-26 at approximately 10:26 am 20 PST, attested to him affirming that the LoFR shown in 21 EXHIBIT R in the defendant's view as being valid and 22 correctly done. 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 14 5.17 The LoFR shown in EXHIBIT R was described as the record of 1 the loan with ZIONS being paid to satisfaction and being 2 recorded with the COUNTY on November 10th, 2009. 3 5.18 The original loan paperwork is clear on what to expect and 4 what should be happening when a sale of a loan from one 5 lender to another occurs. 6 5.19 Land Title of Nez Perce County(hereinafter "LAND TITLE"), 7 now Title One after being acquired by the firm based out of 8 Boise Idaho in 2021, was the original title company assigned 9 as trustee and picked by the trustor Mr. Bass at their 10 original loan's time of execution. 11 5.20 The first knowledge of the alleged fraud came after the 12 title officer from LAND TITLE on 2021-11-16 emailed Mr. Bass 13 following a conversation over THE PROPERTY, where the title 14 officer explained the LoFR and then emailed it to Mr. Bass 15 so he could see what was being explained to him. Showen in 16 EXHIBIT AJ 17 5.21 LAND TITLE, confirms that the normal operation for one 18 lender to sell a loan to another lender is recording a 19 'Successor of deed of trust` and then sending a mailer to 20 inform the customer/borrower of the new company to make 21 payments. 22 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 15 5.22 Upon finding out the existence of erroneous filings shown 1 with the SHEETS CASE, any reasonable assumption would be 2 that the defendants would have done an internal audit 3 regarding any other loans that may have been mistakenly 4 processed and produced by the undersigner and notary the 5 same way as BoA claimed had happened in the SHEETS CASE. 6 5.23 It's inconceivable that a financial institution that big 7 would see and have to go to court over such purported 8 mistakes, and that they didn't bother to secure the 9 integrity of their assets by making sure that it was an 10 isolated incident. 11 5.24 The alleged fraud covers more than just Mr. Bass' account, 12 which is highlighted by the SHEETS CASE, as there seems to 13 be many more records all over the country when viewing other 14 property records which should warrant some more 15 investigation. 16 5.25 In SHEETS CASE, Mr. Sheets had the same set of happenings. 17 5.26 BoA claimed it was a mistake that happened, and when asked 18 how they had said they didn't know. "How the erroneous 19 reconveyance came to be recorded is not clear. Bank of 20 America claims that it caused the reconveyance to be 21 recorded because it mistakenly proceeded as if the 2009 22 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 16 Refinancing had closed." Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. v. 1 Sheets, 160 Idaho 268, 271 (Idaho 2016). 2 5.27 In the approximate time span of twenty-four hrs. was the 3 window of time between 2 Idaho-originated loans with a 4 process that was not everyday happenings of a reconveyance, 5 both occurring in the same window of time, with the same 6 signatories, and the same notary. 7 5.28 Despite knowing that Mr. Bass' account was invalidated, 8 Carrington who acted as the servicing arm for BoA, and 9 before that BAC, both had continued to collect on accounts 10 they knew to be in error. 11 5.29 The SHEETS CASE by proxy has the statute of limitations 12 still running as this is one fraud with many people, not 13 many people, and many frauds; by contrast, they have 14 continued enacting the fraud making it available for any of 15 the other victims to seek action. 16 5.30 In the courtroom on January 26th, 2023, Mr. Newell's 17 account of the order of paperwork appeared to be inconsistent 18 with the actual events, and he made numerous assumptions about 19 Mr. Bass' state of mind, motives, and objectives. 20 5.30.1 Mr. Bass wholeheartedly objects to each of the 21 statements made that were made by Mr. Newell as personal 22 and speculative, making them unusable points pursuant to 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 17 Idaho R. Evid. 401, which addresses the relevance of 1 evidence. 2 5.30.2 Mr. Bass would motion the court, if possible, for 3 each of those assumptive assertions to be stricken from 4 the record. "Evidence is relevant if: it has any 5 tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it 6 would be without the evidence;" Idaho R. Evid. 401; 7 Although blatant attempts to guard shouldn't be 8 surprising, where one hit the fuck around and find out 9 button. 10 5.31 Regarding when Mr. Bass received paperwork to sign for any 11 loan modification, Mr. Newell provided an inaccurate and 12 slanderous account while present in court by stating that Mr. 13 Bass had rejected a loan modification that would have aligned 14 the loan with BoA's assessment of Mr. Bass' financial 15 situation. 16 5.32 The order of events was that in approximately December of 17 2021, Carrington asked Mr. Bass to sign a stack of papers. 18 After reading what they asked Mr. Bass to sign, Mr. Bass found 19 many grievances in the pile of documents, potentially 20 violating the Idaho Consumer Protection Act, Idaho Code § 48-21 601 et seq. 22 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 18 5.32.1 Mr. Bass saw that not only was Mr. Bass' ex-wife's 1 name all over the papers. 2 5.32.2 Carrington's name was also all over the papers, 3 despite the fact that they were not Mr. Bass' loan 4 servicer for BoA until a couple of years later. 5 5.32.3 Carrington backdated the documents to 2012, even 6 though it was 2021. Backdating documents can be 7 considered a fraudulent activity, which might potentially 8 be relevant in a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. §§ 9 1961-1968. 10 5.32.4 As Mr. Bass paused to look into the matter, 11 Carrington sent Mr. Bass several new versions of the 12 paperwork. 13 5.32.5 Carrington offered Mr. Bass a $100 bribe 14 (hereinafter "THE BRIBE", "BRIBING"), which could be 15 considered coercion under contract law principles, 16 potentially rendering the contract voidable or 17 unenforceable under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts 18 § 175 (1981). 19 5.32.6 Carrington called Mr. Bass every other day for 20 months while the forbearance was in place. 21 5.32.7 Carrington sent a notary to Mr. Bass' door, trying 22 to get Mr. Bass to sign. The notary sat with Mr. Bass for 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 19 45 minutes, waiting to get Carrington on his phone to no 1 avail, which could potentially be considered an unfair or 2 deceptive act or practice under Idaho Code § 48-603. 3 5.32.8 Since Mr. Bass didn't have his ex-wife with Mr. 4 Bass, the notary left, and Mr. Bass held onto his copy, 5 which is shown in EXHIBIT AG. 6 5.32.9 This occurred near the end of Mr. Bass' forbearance 7 under the granted to him by CARES Act, 15 U.S. Code § 8 9056 sec. 4022 (b)(2) foreclosure moratorium, and 9 consumer right to request forbearance. 10 5.33 "Upon a request by a borrower for forbearance under 11 paragraph (1), such forbearance shall be granted for up to 180 12 days, and shall be extended for an additional period of up to 13 180 days at the request of the borrower" Forbearance under the 14 CARES Act, 15 U.S. Code § 9056(b)(2) The duration of 15 forbearance was limited at two 180 day periods for a total of 16 360 days. 17 5.34 According to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) 18 website on the page titled "Extend your forbearance," it says 19 that "You may request two additional three-month extensions, 20 up to a maximum of 18 months of total forbearance" shown on 21 Extending your mortgage forbearance | Consumer Financial 22 Protection Bureau website shown in EXHIBIT AI. 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 20 5.35 The forbearance Carrington put Mr. Bass through was 24 1 months by the end, with EXHIBIT AH page 1 showing that the 2 period was going to be extended one more month passed the 23 3 months already applied. That is six months longer than Mr. 4 Bass should have been on the forbearance. 5 5.36 On 11-16-2021 in response to odd behaviors stemming from 6 Carrington's attempts to get Mr. Bass to sign the "fresh ink" 7 copies of backed paperwork, Mr. Bass consulted with the title 8 company, Land Title in Lewiston Idaho. 9 5.37 Land Title is who Mr. Bass knew to be the title company 10 that he had chosen in the original settlement of acquiring the 11 PROPERTY. Mr. Bass never received any notice otherwise that 12 his choice of trustee had been replaced. After explaining all 13 the interactions between Mr. Bass and Carrington to the Title 14 Officer at Land Title, Mr. Bass discovered the existence 15 reconveyance and other instruments, invoking his rights under 16 the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), 12 U.S.C. § 17 2601 et seq. 18 5.38 Defendants admitted in court that they do not possess and 19 will not be able to produce a wet ink copy of the relevant 20 documents. 21 5.39 However, Mr. Bass has a bona fide wet ink copy and can 22 provide them physically but has shown them in EXHIBIT AD as 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 21 evidence in accordance with the Best Evidence Rule, as stated 1 in the Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 1002, and the Idaho R. 2 Evid. 1002. 3 5.40 Mr. Bass was presented with another four variants of the 4 backdated deed of trust, and a promissory note Carrington was 5 despite for Mr. Bass to sign with the date of 2012 and having 6 Carrington's name on the loan documents even though in 2012 7 they were not the servicer or the authorized agent for BoA 8 which these four were presented over the course of a few 9 months starting in 2021. 10 5.41 In addition to the four variations of documentation 11 related to backdating, one distinct partial promissory note 12 for $7,392.91 was presented for signature in 2021, though 13 the papers were dated 2012. 14 5.42 Mr. Bass has no idea where the partial promissory note 15 seems from, nor was it made clear by Carrington or BoA where 16 those came from. 17 5.43 After 15 years, Mr. Bass had gone in reverse as far as how 18 much Mr. Bass owes compared to when Mr. Bass took out the 19 loan purportedly. 20 5.44 On the loan modification papers sent in April 2022, it had 21 a partial promissory note of $14,390.38 with what appears to 22 be an additional $1500 with no reason for it, Mr. Bass just 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 22 expected to accept it, or they would foreclose on his 1 property. 2 5.45 The amount in the backdated documents totaled $150,101.91 3 for 2012, giving a $3682 balance that only grew from 2008 to 4 2012 when the balance should have been closer to $116,900, 5 which is $33,201 off the expected balance of that time. 6 5.46 As of April 2022, Carrington was saying that Mr. Bass owed 7 $129,541, which is approximately $18,121 over what the 8 Amortization Schedule would have Mr. Bass estimated amount, 9 which should be at roughly $111,420 if everything was to 10 have gone correct starting from 2008. 11 5.47 The notes erroneously included the name "Aimee Bass." 12 While her name was likely added due to our marital status at 13 the time of the original loan, it is inaccurate as she was 14 never a party to the loan, held any responsibility for it, 15 or had any claim to THE PROPERTY at any time. Her inclusion 16 in the documents was incorrect. 17 5.48 Carrington mortgage stressed the importance of getting a 18 fresh ink copy of the backdated promissory notes and deed of 19 trust for 2012 despite being in 2021. 20 5.49 Carrington felt it so necessary that Mr. Bass signed the 21 backdated paperwork that they were BRIBING Mr. Bass signed 22 the paperwork. 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 23 5.50 When Mr. Bass was finally exited from the forbearance 1 period, he was presented in 2022 with the mortgage 2 modification papers from Carrington, which was the loan 3 modification not signed referenced by Mr. Newell. 4 5.51 Carrington was pushing this new loan on Mr. Bass. All 5 urgency or interest in if the papers they were backdating to 6 2012 were signed at all. Carrington went from bribing Mr. 7 Bass into signing the backdated 2012 versions of paperwork 8 claimed to have been absolutely necessary to sign because 9 that is what the county needed, to skipping past that 10 purported requirement as long as I signed these new papers 11 as I exited the forbearance. 12 5.52 Carrington presented loan modification paperwork at the 13 end of Mr. Bass' forbearance period in which there was not 14 negotiations just a demand to sign them or be foreclosed on. 15 5.53 Carrington tacked on an additional $1500 fee for doing the 16 paperwork on the loan modification. That is contrary to the 17 CARES Act, 15 U.S. Code § 9056 sec. 4022 (c)(1) "…no fees, 18 penalties, or interest (beyond the amounts scheduled or 19 calculated as if the borrower made all contractual payments 20 on time and in full under the terms of the mortgage 21 contract) charged to the borrower in connection with the 22 forbearance…" 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 24 5.54 Carrington in the refinance paperwork took a loan with 15 1 years left and reset the loan to 30 years again, gaining 15 2 more years of profiting at homeowner's expense. 3 5.55 Carrington has been found guilty of many violations of the 4 laws, as shown in EXHIBIT AG, which include the previous 5 accounts of actions. 6 5.56 Mr. Bass can provide a wet ink copy of the original loan, 7 which Carrington and BoA, by proxy, have attested to the 8 importance of having the original copy in every attempt to 9 have Mr. Bass sign backdated papers. 10 5.57 No original copy of the second note can be produced, which 11 Defendants have attested to in court. 12 5.58 Mr. Bass does have a wet ink copy of the last loan that he 13 knows to be correct and legally binding. 14 5.59 On or about October 2009, Defendant Bank purchased the 15 loan from the Original Bank. 16 5.60 Defendant Bank was required to correctly assign the 17 original loan to itself in connection with the loan purchase 18 from ZIONS, as shown in EXHIBIT Q and EXHIBIT AD on page 25. 19 5.61 In the original agreement shown in EXHIBIT AD on page 25, 20 the SERVICING DISCLOSURE STATEMENT was very clear about the 21 process and what to expect, which does not align with what 22 we saw happen. In that binding contract, it states: 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 25 "Transfer Practices and Requirements: If the servicing of 1 your loan is assigned, sold, or transferred to a new 2 servicer, you must be given written notice of that transfer. 3 The present loan servicer must send you notice in writing…." 4 5.62 12 CFR 1024.33(a) states that the expected way a loan 5 moves from one lender to another is "the servicing of the 6 mortgage loan may be assigned, sold, or transferred to any 7 other person…" which all avenues in the Federal Code do not 8 include or even indicate that it is ok to have an FHA backed 9 loan paid off within the first year by the borrower with 10 money that they borrowed from another lender in order to 11 facilitate a move of the loan. 12 5.63 It is repeatedly said that the borrower may not, under 13 penalty, use borrowed funds to secure an FHA loan. 14 5.64 The loan is still seen as an FHA loan. 15 5.65 BoA is claiming Mr. Bass committed a crime and that BoA 16 helped him to do so by knowingly giving him a loan for an 17 FHA back mortgage he already had. 18 5.66 BoA is claiming they helped Mr. Bass pay off that first 19 loan by opening up a second active loan presented as an FHA-20 backed loan taken out by the first-time home buyer for the 21 second time, using that money to pay off the loan while taking 22 a loss. 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 26 5.67 However, instead of properly assigning the original loan, 1 Defendant Bank, without the knowledge or consent of Mr. 2 Bass, created a second deed of trust and promissory note, 3 effectively doubling Mr. Bass' debt. 4 5.68 BoA took over the loan on October 16th as per their 5 reporting to a third-party source of Experian to be shown in 6 Exhibits AF. 7 5.69 INSERT ZION'S ACCOUNTING OF THE SALE TO BoA — COMING SOON 8 5.70 In the agreement on the original loan shown in EXHIBIT AD 9 page 13, there is a requirement on reconveyance that notice 10 was to be sent, which, when BoA failed to do so, breached 11 the loan/contract that they had transferred to them. 12 5.71 Defendant Mr. Newell, in courtroom 2 in the Nez Perce 13 county district two on January 26th, 2023, at approximately 14 11:59 am, attested that they had no wet inked copy and 15 conceded that as a matter of fact. 16 5.72 The standard procedure when a lender sells loans to 17 another lender is to do an "assignment of deed of trust," 18 and the trustor (borrower) gets noticed as they did in the 19 2012 assignment of deed per EXHIBIT Q. 20 5.73 For nearly a month, Mr. Bass was responsible for two 21 loans, each with a value of $148,612, totaling $297,224. 22 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 27 5.74 Mr. Bass attests that they would never have been able to 1 make payments on such an amount, nor was Mr. Bass ever made 2 aware that such a debt had been put upon him. 3 5.75 Mr. Bass could barely get approval for the first loan with 4 Zion's to purchase THE PROPERTY, so a second loan was 5 impossible. 6 5.76 Mr. Bass did not earn enough then to allow for two 7 $148,612 loans, and BoA a year before had flatly rejected 8 Mr. Bass' first home loan application. 9 5.77 After a year's worth of payments on the loan, the second 10 loan BoA is saying Mr. Bass took out was for an amount that 11 somehow increased by +$2196 from the original amount of 12 $146,418 to $148,612 with no explanations of why. 13 5.78 EXHIBIT AE shows that Amortization-Schedule for the loan 14 puts the change in the total amount owed down by -$1678 for 15 the total of $144,740, which makes sense as when you pay on 16 a loan, it shouldn't increase but decrease. 17 5.79 12 "The term 'amortizing loan' means a loan in which 18 payment of the periodic payments does not result in an 19 increase in the principal balance under the terms of the 20 legal obligation; the term 'negative amortization' means 21 payment of periodic payments that will result in an increase 22 in the principal balance under the terms of the legal 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 28 obligation; the term' negative amortization loan' means a 1 loan, other than a reverse mortgage subject to § 1026.33, 2 that provides for a minimum periodic payment that covers 3 only a portion of the accrued interest, resulting in 4 negative amortization." CFR 1026.18(s)(7)(v), The original 5 loan is shown in EXHIBIT AD pg. 19 not to be a negatively 6 amortized loan. 7 5.80 There was no guarantee that either of the active loans Mr. 8 Bass had been burdened with would be resolved without making 9 payments on both loans. 10 5.81 If another "account error" had occurred and the 11 reconveyance had not been done, Mr. Bass would have had no 12 proof that the first loan was paid off, exposing Mr. Bass to 13 financial injury. 14 5.82 Defendants have yet to have a third party verify the 15 source of the funds that paid off that first loan, as said 16 in the full reconveyance. 17 5.83 It is just as likely that the loan was paid off by a 18 benefactor as it is that BoA let Mr. Bass take out a loan to 19 pay Zions off so that he could see the amount owed increase 20 to his detriment. 21 5.84 A third party is required to prove that the funds that 22 were put up to pay off the first loan were not hidden in a 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 29 trick of accounting and technology where a lender takes in a 1 payment from a benefactor who pays off a loan and defuses 2 the amount of the transaction over a batch of other accounts 3 spanning a few years, adjusting the transaction by a few 4 pennies amount then regenerating past statements as needed 5 to cover a redirection of money and other one financial 6 tracks, which that whole scenario is just one of the many 7 possibilities in which Mr. Bass has seen in his past work 8 where he needed to add security features to systems and 9 software in efforts to thwart this abuse while at WSU and 10 other financial institutions. 11 5.85 As Zion's Bank and Land Tile described, Mr. Bass, attests 12 to having witnessed and participated in what appeared to be 13 the everyday happening of a loan sold to another lender. Mr. 14 Bass was given notice that BoA was where Mr. Bass was to 15 make payments moving forward. 16 5.86 Mr. Bass has no recollection of signing anything only a 17 year later, after getting the loan, only that Mr. Bass was 18 upset over being sold off to a bank that had turned him down 19 before. 20 5.87 At no time does Mr. Bass recall signing any new paperwork 21 after the 2008 paperwork. 22 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 30 5.88 A third party is needed to clarify the accounting 1 questions in this proceeding. BoA has been proven not to be 2 upfront or forth telling and has been shown to have been 3 engaging in similar fraudulent activities. The main issue 4 needing the third party is to prove that there was no unjust 5 enrichment stemming from the extra ~$150k of future revenue 6 shown on paper which a bank would borrow against or use for 7 other financial gains. If, in the period where Mr. Bass was 8 unknowingly responsible for the two loans, there was any 9 gain that can be partly because of the value perceived on 10 having the extra income, they are being unjustly enriched. 11 5.89 BoA was fined $4 billion for inflating their books through 12 various means. 13 5.90 "Evidence of a person's habit or an organization's routine 14 practice may be admitted to prove that on a particular 15 occasion the person or organization acted in accordance with 16 the habit or routine practice. The court may admit this 17 evidence regardless of whether it is corroborated or whether 18 there was an eyewitness." Idaho R. Evid. 501 19 5.91 EXHIBIT AA - a laundry list of offenses of exact same 20 nature shows a pattern of fraud. 21 5.92 Idaho R. Evid. 702. Testimony by Expert Witnesses. 22 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 31 5.92.1 A witness who is qualified as an expert by 1 knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education 2 may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if 3 the expert's scientific, technical, or other 4 specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to 5 understand the evidence or to determine a fact in 6 issue. 7 5.93 EXHIBIT AC - Mr. Bass is an expert in the field needed to 8 show that the signatures are not valid. 9 5.93.1 "[T]he existence of [specific] intent must be 10 corroborated by objective facts. Specific intent, however, 11 can seldom be proven by direct evidence: [Intent] must be 12 proved by the reasonable inferences shown by the evidence 13 and the surrounding circumstances. If there are reasonable 14 inferences and sufficient circumstances then the issue of 15 intent becomes a question of fact for the jury." See State 16 v. Green, 861 P.2d 954, 961. 17 6. CAUSE OF ACTIONS 18 6.1 Arguments (Overview) 19 6.1.1 In support of each of the following causes of action, 20 Mr. Bass expressly incorporates and restates all preceding 21 factual allegations and averments as if set forth in full 22 within each specific cause of action. 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 32 6.1.2 Mr. Bass respectfully requests that the Court reconsider 1 its OPINION AND ORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS AND STRIKE THE 2 SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT and ORDER ON MOTIONS FOR 3 RECONSIDERATION. The defendants' motion attempted to evade 4 its liability for its fraudulent behavior. Defendants 5 committed fraud by concealing the existence of a second 6 mortgage on the property, which put Mr. Bass at 7 significant risk had they failed to put out the 8 reconveyance. Defendants should not be rewarded for their 9 bad-faith actions. 10 6.1.3 Mr. Bass has established the essential elements of the 11 claim for fraud by showing that Defendants made a false 12 representation of a material fact with knowledge of its 13 falsity and with the intent to deceive Mr. Bass. 14 Defendants concealed the existence of the second mortgage 15 and its satisfaction. They continued to accept payments 16 from Mr. Bass for years until covid hit. The continuous 17 lies to keep the actions unnoticed and actions that are 18 out of the normal but hidden from sight are why Mr. Bass 19 was unaware of the second mortgage or conveyance. Mr. Bass 20 immediately started to dig once the defendant's behavior 21 differed from the norm. The defendants' conduct is 22 unconscionable and violates the principles of equity and 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 33 justice. 1 6.1.4 Defendants should not be allowed to keep the profits 2 they gained from their fraudulent behavior, as that would 3 be unjust enrichment. Mr. Bass has made payments on the 4 property since the loan started, but those payments would 5 and should not be considered a benefit to Defendants, as 6 it obtained the payments by fraud and perpetuated its 7 growth. The doctrine of unclean hands bars Defendants from 8 profiting from their wrongdoing. 9 6.1.5 Mr. Bass' interest in the property is superior to that 10 of the Defendants, as Mr. Bass' interests were 11 transplanted from one title lineage that was unclouded to 12 a new one with the second mortgage through fraud. 13 Defendant has unclean hands, as it concealed the second 14 mortgage by not following through with requirements to 15 send the paperwork to Mr. Bass despite it being said right 16 on the top of the letter. Still, the Defendants kept this 17 information from Mr. Bass and continued accepting property 18 payments. Mr. Bass is entitled to relief in equity, and 19 Defendants should be required to release the second 20 mortgage and convey the property to Mr. Bass free and 21 clear of any encumbrances as to keep it would be rewarded 22 for the fraudulent behaviors. Still, more reasons to 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 34 support Mr. Bass' requests will be further supported in 1 the coming read. 2 6.1.6 Exclusion of Information Beyond the Statute of 3 Limitations: 4 6.1.7 Mr. Bass asserts that any information regarding late 5 payments or adverse financial history older than the 6 applicable statute of limitations for credit reporting 7 should not be used against Mr. Bass in this matter. Under 8 Idaho law, the statute of limitations for reporting late 9 payments and other negative financial information on a 10 credit report is seven years (insert the correct duration 11 as per Idaho law). 12 6.1.8 Mr. Bass contends that once the statute of limitations 13 has expired, the negative information should no longer 14 have any bearing on Mr. Bass' financial standing or 15 ability to obtain credit. This is consistent with credit 16 reporting statutes, which aim to provide a fair and 17 accurate representation of an individual's 18 creditworthiness while allowing them to move on from past 19 financial mistakes. 20 6.1.9 Therefore, Mr. Bass respectfully requests that the Court 21 exclude and deem inadmissible any information regarding 22 late payments or negative financial history that is older 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 35 than the applicable statute of limitations for credit 1 reporting under Idaho law. This exclusion will ensure that 2 Mr. Bass' financial background is accurately and fairly 3 represented in this matter and will prevent Defendants 4 from using outdated information to undermine Mr. Bass' 5 claims or credibility. 6 6.1.10 The illegality of Borrowing money for a down payment on 7 Another Loan: 8 6.1.10.1 Mr. Bass asserts that under Idaho law and federal 9 lending regulations, it is generally prohibited to 10 borrow money for the purpose of making a down payment on 11 another loan. This prohibition is in place to ensure 12 responsible lending practices and to protect borrowers 13 from entering into unmanageable debt situations (see 14 Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq.; 15 Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. § 1026.1 et seq). 16 6.1.10.2 In the present case, BoA alleges that Mr. Bass paid 17 off one loan with another loan and did so at a loss. 18 Such an action, if true, would be inconsistent with Mr. 19 Bass' best interests and raises questions about the 20 legality and propriety of the loan transaction. 21 6.1.10.3 Mr. Bass contends that this alleged loan 22 transaction, as described by BoA, is not only 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 36 counterintuitive but also potentially in violation of 1 lending regulations. By suggesting that Mr. Bass 2 willingly participated in such a transaction, BoA is 3 implying that Mr. Bass acted irrationally or with 4 disregard for their own financial well-being. This 5 argument is in line with the doctrine of 6 unconscionability, which prohibits the enforcement of 7 contract terms that are excessively one-sided or 8 oppressive (see Idaho Code § 28-2-302). 9 6.1.10.4 Mr. Bass respectfully requests that the Court 10 examine the legality of the loan transaction as 11 described by BoA in light of relevant lending laws and 12 doctrines. If the Court determines that the transaction 13 is in violation of lending regulations or contrary to 14 Mr. Bass' best interests, it should consider this 15 finding as further evidence supporting Mr. Bass' claims 16 and undermining BoA's position (see, e.g., Williams v. 17 Walker-Thomas Furniture Co., 350 F.2d 445 (D.C. Cir. 18 1965)). 19 6.1.10.5 The original loan expressly stated that the 20 borrower, Mr. Bass, was to have used his own earned and 21 saved funds to put as a down payment, which is 22 inconsistent with using one loan to pay off another and 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 37 is shown in EXHIBIT AD pg. 4 and many other places. 1 6.2 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION (Fraudulent Misrepresentation) 2 6.2.1 Defendants made a false representation of material 3 facts. BoA has met this element in multitudes but used 4 that ambiguity to mask their actions as a misdirection of 5 sorts. One example is the concealment of the LOFR. 6 6.2.2 The defendants knew the statement was false when 7 making it. 8 6.2.3 Defendants intended for Mr. Bass to rely on the false 9 statement. 10 6.2.4 Mr. Bass relied justifiably on the false statement. 11 6.2.5 Mr. Bass suffered damages due to their reliance on the 12 Defendants' false statement, in an amount to be proven at 13 trial. 14 6.3 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION (Fraud) 15 6.3.1 Defendant Bank knowingly and intentionally created the 16 second deed of trust and promissory note with the intent 17 of deceiving Mr. Bass and avoiding the proper assignment 18 process to gain benefit for appearing to have more than 19 what was actually owed to BoA. 20 6.3.2 Mr. Bass reasonably relied on Defendant Bank's 21 representations regarding the status of the loan, unaware 22 of the unauthorized second deed of trust and promissory 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 38 note. When Mr. Bass expected the transfer as it was in the 1 loan papers, although he protested, and there was nothing 2 done that appeared to be out of line, Mr. Bass had no way 3 to signal to him that a costly investigation needed to be 4 done on his behalf. 5 6.3.3 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant Bank's 6 fraudulent actions, Mr. Bass has suffered damages in an 7 amount to be proven at trial. 8 6.4 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION (Negligent Misrepresentation) 9 6.4.1 Defendant Bank negligently misrepresented the status 10 of Mr. Bass' loan, creating a second deed of trust and 11 promissory note without Mr. Bass' knowledge or consent and 12 without performing the proper assignment process. 13 6.4.2 Mr. Bass reasonably relied on Defendant Bank's 14 representations regarding the status of the loan, unaware 15 of the unauthorized second deed of trust and promissory 16 note. 17 6.4.3 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant Bank's 18 negligent misrepresentation, Mr. Bass has suffered damages 19 in an amount to be proven at trial. 20 6.5 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION (Breach of Contract) 21 6.5.1 A valid and enforceable contract existed between Mr. 22 Bass and Original Bank, which was transferred to Defendant 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 39 Bank upon the purchase of the loan. 1 6.5.2 Defendant Bank breached the terms of the contract by 2 creating a second deed of trust and promissory note 3 without the knowledge or consent of Mr. Bass and without 4 performing the proper assignment process. 5 6.5.3 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant Bank's 6 breach of contract, Mr. Bass has suffered damages at an 7 amount to be proven at trial. 8 6.6 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION (Unjust Enrichment - payments) 9 6.6.1 As a result of Defendant Bank's unauthorized creation 10 of the second deed of trust and promissory note and 11 subsequent actions, Defendant Bank has been unjustly 12 enriched at the expense of Mr. Bass. 13 6.6.2 Mr. Bass has conferred a benefit upon Defendant Bank 14 by providing capital to earn off as well as paying 15 additional interest and fees on the second loan, as well 16 as suffering damage to their credit and emotional 17 distress. 18 6.6.3 Defendant Bank has knowingly and willingly accepted 19 and retained this benefit under circumstances that make 20 it inequitable for Defendants to retain the benefit 21 without compensating Mr. Bass. 22 6.6.4 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant Bank's 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 40 unjust enrichment, Mr. Bass has suffered damages at an 1 amount to be proven at trial. 2 6.7 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION (Declaratory Relief) 3 6.7.1 An actual controversy has arisen and now exists 4 between Mr. Bass and Defendant concerning the validity 5 and enforceability of the second deed of trust and 6 promissory note. 7 6.7.2 Mr. Bass seeks a judicial determination and 8 declaration of the parties' rights and obligations under 9 the loan agreement and the second deed of trust and 10 promissory note, specifically declaring the second deed 11 of trust and promissory note to be void and 12 unenforceable. 13 6.8 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION (Violation of Idaho's Consumer 14 Protection Act) 15 6.8.1 Defendant Bank engaged in unfair and deceptive acts 16 or practices in the conduct of its business by creating 17 the unauthorized second deed of trust and promissory 18 note, executing a full reconveyance on the first note, 19 and attempting to have Mr. Bass sign a backdated new 20 promissory note. 21 6.8.2 Defendant Bank's actions violate Idaho's Consumer 22 Protection Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts 23 or practices in the conduct of trade or commerce. 24 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 41 6.8.3 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant Bank's 1 violation of Idaho's Consumer Protection Act, Mr. Bass 2 has suffered damages in an amount to be proven at trial. 3 6.9 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION (Unjust Enrichment - deed) 4 6.9.1 "Unjust enrichment occurs where a defendant receives a 5 benefit which would be inequitable to retain without 6 compensating Mr. Bass to the extent that retention is 7 unjust." Vanderford v. Knudson, 144 Idaho 547, 558 (Idaho 8 2007). "The substance of an action for unjust enrichment 9 lies in a promise, implied by law, that a party will 10 render to the person entitled thereto that which in 11 equity and good conscience belongs to the latter." Smith 12 v. Smith, 95 Idaho 477, 484, 511 P.2d 294, 301 (1973). 13 "The elements of unjust enrichment are that (1) a benefit 14 is conferred on the defendant by the plaintiff; (2) 15 Defendants appreciates the benefit; and (3) it would be 16 inequitable for the defendant to accept the benefit 17 without payment of the value of the benefit." Teton Peaks 18 Inv. Co., LLC v. Ohme, 146 Idaho 394, 398, 195 P.3d 1207, 19 1211 (2008) . As a direct and proximate result of 20 Defendant Bank's unjust enrichment, Mr. Bass has suffered 21 damages in an amount to be proven at trial. 22 VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 42 7.1 WHEREFORE, Mr. Bass prays for judgment against Defendants as 1 follows: 2 7.1.a. For actual damages in an amount to be determined at 3 trial, including but not limited to any costs and expenses 4 incurred in connection with this action; and 5 7.1.b. For statutory damages, if any, as allowed by law; and 6 7.1.c. For a declaratory judgment that Mr. Bass' property is 7 free and clear of any liens or encumbrances arising from 8 the actions of Defendants; and 9 7.1.d. For costs of this action, including reasonable 10 attorney's fees or the average cost of fees for 11 compensation of Mr. Bass' time and efforts, where possible 12 and the court would see fit and within the court's powers 13 to do so; and 14 7.1.e. For pre-/post-judgment interest as allowed by law; and 15 7.1.f. A temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction, 16 and permanent injunction enjoining Defendants, their 17 agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and all persons 18 acting in concert or participation with them, from 19 proceeding with the sale of the Property scheduled for 20 March 31st, 2023, or later date; and 21 7.1.g. For an Order for Defendants to cover the costs and do 22 the work to reset Mr. Bass' credit to a perfect score, as 23 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 43 they are equipped to carry out the restoration with little 1 effort; and 2 7.1.h. For an Order for Defendants to cover costs and 3 facilitate any work needed to correct the tax implications, 4 issues, debts, and or losses from past returns that Mr. 5 Bass should have earned, which should be assessed and 6 calculated by an agreed upon third-party; and 7 7.1.i. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems 8 just and proper; and 9 7.1.j. Mr. Bass preys that the American people will see orders 10 to hold all defendants further accountable. We should see 11 charges & appropriate indictments be taken against 12 Defendants for their actions; for someone to step in and 13 cure the bluntly inflicted injury to the American 14 population by yet another fraud. Mr. Bass preys to see a 15 similar cap in size, break up, and all top management and 16 C-suite are barred from the bank industry for life. Just 17 like Wells Fargo, they made fake accounts, and it appears 18 they were not the only ones. Like that disgraced bank, BoA 19 and subsidies should be hobbled as they are not worthy of 20 the power they hold now. 21 VIII. Conclusion 22 PETITION TO MODIFY OR AMEND AN COMPLAINT PAGE 44 For the foregoing reasons, Mr. Bass respectfully requests 1 that the Court allow the case to be heard and plead in a trial. 2 Mr. Bass has suffered financial harm due to the Defendants' 3 fraudulent behavior, and Defendants should be held liable for 4 their conduct. Mr. Bass is entitled to the property free and 5 clear of any encumbrances and to damages for the harm suffered. 6 7 Dated this _24___ day of March 2023. Respectfully submitted, Jeremy L.

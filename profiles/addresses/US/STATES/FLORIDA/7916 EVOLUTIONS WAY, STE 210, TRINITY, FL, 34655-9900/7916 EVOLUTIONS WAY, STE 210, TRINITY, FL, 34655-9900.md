Lori Hermansen RMP did an amazing job while I was a tenant with your company. I lived in a great house in Port Richey and when I look to buy a home I will likely go through your company to do so. Thank you so much Lori you have gone above and beyond during my stay there to get the fence issue that was another property owners responsibility and other things that need to be taken care and she got the job done. Thank you again!!

Kyle has been great with us. We have been working with him since October and we never expected him to work so hard for us. He has been professional and responsive the entire time.  My wife even called him on the weekends and he has always picked up. We will always recommend Kyle to anyone...

As owners we asked a lot of him and we were never misled or felt as if we were asking too much

We want to thank you for being excellent!!!

Best TEAM ever!!  Being a bi-coastal Actress and Real Estate professional myself... I know amazing people when I deal with them.  I got called to work across the country in Los Angeles, CA and my "other half" got a job transfer elsewhere.  I could not have asked for a better Team of professional HELPERS (from my own RE brokerage) with our FL house rental!  They assisted in Moving recommendations, new appliance deliveries/installations, getting the house rental-ready and finding us fabulous tenants!  Here we are a year later and even in "trying times"... we are still very HAPPY!--so THANK YOU Rick and Sue Wedig (Liz too)!! ** I highly recommend. ;) xoxoxo

She did a great job keeping everything in order and e everyone in contact. At no time did I ever feel I confused or lost abt any part of my move. If you happen to get Sue as an agent be very thankful because she is truly awesome at what she doesüòâ

Thank you Berkshire

I have worked with Keyanna Jacobs from Berkshire Hathaway for many years, both as a real estate agent while selling and purchasing properties, as well as a property manager for my rental properties. Keyanna is quick to respond to answers and proactive in solving problems. She always strategizes the best approaches and works diligently until they come to fruition. I have been very satisfied in having her as my property manager and happy that she has joined Berkshire Hathaway. I have used innumerous property management companies in the past and I've been the most pleased while working with them. They have an elaborate, solid process, and a precise approach to property management.

I will recommend Berkshire Hathaway to anyone who have an investment property in the area and want to rent it out .  Agents are truly honest and looking for the right renters for your property. Very happy with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices to manage my property... Thanks Tom and Kathy for your help..

She truly makes your life easier and sees things through to the end. Meagan set the bar high and is by far one of my favorite people in the industry.

This is the worst company I've ever dealt with in my life.  They are unprofessional, incompetent and totally out for themselves.  They make decisions about your property as if they were the owner, like offering a 9 month rental on a unit that's only available for 6 months.  They don't respond to phone calls, they hold on to owner's funds and spend the reserve like it's their own checkbook.     Our tenant left this disgusting dirty pan, unmade beds, burned out light bulbs, broken toilet and took many of the things that were part of the unit (trash cans, toilet brushes, etc).   Not only did I have to pay for it,  they were afraid to charge the tenant's security deposit, they did a walk through and cleared the unit as ready to be re-rented even with a broken toilet.  You will be miserable if you work with anyone at Berkshire Hathaway.   Avoid them at all cost!!!!

Lack or missing communication can be troublesome.   As a web software engineer for many decades, your web portal is lousy at best.   Having worked with fiscal systems for many decades, your accounting and/or explanation of funds is convoluted making it difficult to reconcile.  Finally, service and fees are quite expensive.   Like my representative and not having to deal with too many things.    What I actually pay you for is keeping my stress levels down.  It doesn't always work out that way though.  Would be hard pressed to recommend w/o more affordability and streamlined changes at your customer and business flow levels.

I've only been with Berkshire Hathaway since last year, so far so good.  By the end of this year I will have more experience with them and will give them a better rating.  Before Berkshire Hathaway I was another company and they were absolutely horrible!  I couldn't give them even one star.  Bogus work that I was charged for and didn't return my calls, I was livid with them!   That's why I am giving 4 stars to Berkshire Hathaway, when I call they return my calls in a timely manner.  Customer service is everything to me.

My wife and I are retired. We travel and explore this beautiful country of ours in our motor coach. I thought I could manage our rental property in FL while traveling. WRONG..after two flacky renters and a year  of inconsistent  rents I contacted Berkshire Hathaway Florida Properties and was put in touch with
Lori Hermansen. Lori is a very professional and knowledgeable property manager. She is always available when ever I call or email and if tied up returns my call by end of the day. Lori always has our best interests in mind as well as the return on our investment property and that gives us peace of mind. Following Lori‚Äôs advice of how to clean up our property an make it rent ready, she had us rented in three weeks and at a 40% increase in the rent.
We Highly Recommend Lori to anyone who needs property management or real estate advise. Thank you Lori.

Thankful for Sue Wedig!

Tomorrow being Thanksgiving 2018 I just wanted to pop over here and give "Thanks" for Sue Wedig!  My family and I are relocating from the Georgia area and decided to start our new journey and new chapter in the Florida area.  My husband and I had found a home that we thought was the "right home" for us to rent for a year to get to know the area before deciding on making a purchase.  We waited and waited to hear back on the other home for approval with their HOA and became frustrated since it was keeping us in limbo with our closing date for our home fast approaching.  We contacted our Agent and asked if she could please send us more homes to consider while we were waiting and on that same day we found a listing we really liked in one of our top communities of choice and had ALL of the things we really wanted initially and lucky for us this home was listed by Sue Wedig.  Having been in the real estate industry my husband and myself for over a decade I'm aware of all the moving parts of when someone is relocating and making a move and the sensitivity that is so greatly needed!  After waiting for this other home I got in contact with Sue and then put our Agent in contact with her.  We dealt with Sue a bit more on this home just because of taking care of the legalities to secure the home, etc.  Sue went Above and BEYOND for our family and our pets, she showed us kindness and compassion with regards to understanding we needed to have answers and quickly with our move and our closing approaching as well as her attention to detail and care for the Owners she represented their needs as well us now being their new tenants.  Their process for a rental which was new for my husband and I since we had been in our home for eighteen plus years was a bit nerve racking to think about renting but Sue and her processes took the stress out of things for us.  Again being someone who has worked in the real estate industry and now becoming a renter I know the in's, the out's and the nuances well so it was a pleasure for my husband and I to now be on the other side and have someone like Sue in our corner to assist our family.  They say one of the biggest stresses in life is moving but for us it was two stresses moving and moving out of state!  So I would highly recommend Sue whether you are considering a move across town or a move to this state!  She will take really good care of you, your family as well as your pets, will be transparent with you, mindfully honest with you, will set the proper realistic expectations for you and your family to be successful and most importantly you will be able to rest comfortably knowing that you are in truly good hands with her!  By the way we did hear back from the first rental, was approved but because of Sue we Happily Declined!

Thank you Sue for being a BLESSING in our families life and Happy Thanksgiving to you and yours!

My wife Florika and I would like to say that our experience with our two agents
Lori Hermansen and Rick Redman has been wonderful.  They are both true professionals, caring, understanding and most of all extremely honest.  They were there with advise, compassion and understanding of our situation they truly cared and did everything possible to make our experience with them and your company truly comfortable.  Even though we live in New York they handled everything for us in Florida we would highly recommend them to our friends and to anyone who needs real estate advise or handling of their property. They are both true professionals, kind, caring and understanding.  More people in todays world should be like Lori & Rick.

I don't recommend using this company if you have to go through Phyllis "Lynn" Sweazy. She consistently lied to us, and blew us off on numerous occasions when we needed things done in the home. She is very unprofessional, and very snotty and rude. She insisted on letting herself into our home on numerous occasions to show the home while we were still in it, although we voiced we were uncomfortable with it. Once it was all said and done she charged us for ridiculous  things on our deposit and didn't provide invoices.  Overall a terrible person with a terrible attitude toward tenants.

I would give no STARS. I‚Äôve emailed the company customer care no response, emailed a realtor of a property no response. It‚Äôs unprofessional, you rent houses. You should check and make sure your realtors who cover properties are actually doing there JOB because they‚Äôre causing you renters. Save your time, app fee and rent to an agency who takes the time to respond back.

Housing discrimination at its finest. I've been waiting a month for a Preapproval letter. At this point I've obtained other funding and made an offer which was accepted. This loan officer and her manager Emily Coppola and Tim Petersen then asks me for the purchase agreement signed by me and the seller, which against my better judgment I provided and still have yet to get a pre approval or denial. Now they're asking if I have permission to work remotely though they've ran all my info we've went over that and it's been a month.

Wells Fargo loan 2006 ..on 3 years pipe burst ruining over $80,000 worth of damage. Although the builder was sued by Wells Fargo & claimed responsibility for the damage they penalized us raising insurance $400. Markets flipped in 2008 .. we had to short sell our house and damage our credit for years. My credit was 730 at loan, now its 640 ..its all because of Wells Fargo. They recovered their money when they syed the builders ..yet continue to punish us...not through with the damage in our credit it has ruined us for...because of actions they were unwilling to take on our behalf. I called them for  hours and days calling calling calling asking them to change this to help us to give us some type of grace on this they refused to cooperate in any way shape or form. I hate Wells Fargo for what they did to my family and how they run our credit history for the last 6 years.

IF YOURE A VETERAN, DO NOT USE YOUR BENEFITS HERE!!!!! I purchased a home whil on active duty.  A few months after leaving active duty, hurricane Matthew caused damage to my home that I was having trouble repairing and it cause me financial hardship and I called and spoke to Aaron Inmhoff(spelling) and he said I was covered under the natural disaster hardship for the incident. He also told me that it would put my loan on hold until I could make the repairs.  I asked why that meant and he said it meant I would NOT accrue any late payments until the repairs were made.  It took me quite a while to recover from the extra debt that the hurricane caused, and I kept him up to date in this.  I attempted to make a few payments, but was denied because they weren't the full amount, even though he had insisted I could do so.  Eventually, I was contacted and told they were pursuing foreclosure. I called and spoke with a different agent and explained to her how I had been lied to.  Turns out, the whole time my account was racking up late payments to the point where it would be impossible for me to bring the account current in the time they wanted.  BIG SURPRISE!  So, she agreed to do another review on my account.  I was told they would let me know by the middle of August.  I lost track and had NOT received one single phone call or piece of mail letting me know the outcome.  Instead, today, I find the foreclosure document taped to my front door, which is completely tacky and immature, and they've filed without saying anything to me or giving me any options but this one, which benefits them so they can make a profit off the back of a single mother veteran who they assured they would do everything they could to help.  Bottom line, Wells Fargo is the same as they've always been....evil, money hungry and they couldn't care less about who they hurt in the process.  Nothing is lower than to take advantage of our veterans.  Take your business elsewhere.  I'm hoping that the VA takes my story to heart and ends their busines with these predators.

As another reviewer stated, do not use this address to physically go there.  50328 is a ZIP Code solely used by Wells Fargo.  Being that is a Des Moines ZIP Code, Google places the map marker in central Des Moines.  The physical location is actually 815 Wells Fargo Trail, West Des Moines, IA 50266.

I had perfect payment and credit score of about 720 plus, well I found today that when I called them to ask for a modification and they put me in a forbearance for 3, then said I could apply for a modification after that, (the same day 90 days later they had their collections people calling) hit my credit report with deficiency reports then when I called to apply for the mod (like they said I could, they told me I do not qualify). So why did they look at my credit and payment history and decide to ruin my payment history. I got it good! If you want it good, you can get here! GOOD LUCK TO YOU! So now no one will want to refi or do a mod with me! Rippin Off America in full swing!

It took 4 months to close on my loan.  The underwriters keep asking for information and some which I sent 3 times.   I will never use Wells Fargo Home Mortgage again and it refer anyone to them

Please don't drive here if you are looking for Wells Fargo. This is the George Washington Carver Community School. This is not the main campus. That is in West Des Moines.

Called customer service because my wife got a letter that I had died. The lady on the phone was very nice. She kept apologizing.

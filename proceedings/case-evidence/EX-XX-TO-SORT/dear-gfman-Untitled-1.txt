Subject: Immediate Action Required: Illegal Foreclosure Auction and Systematic Violations of Law

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to urgently request your intervention in stopping an illegal foreclosure auction of my property scheduled for February 29, 2024. This situation is not merely a civil dispute but involves a series of criminal acts by Bank of America (BoA), certain local developers, and complicit legal professionals, culminating in an auction that, if allowed to proceed, will consummate these crimes.

Detailed Account and Evidence:

Upcoming Foreclosure Auction:

Violation: The impending auction represents the apex of a long-standing collusion aimed at fraudulently transferring my property to a pre-selected buyer, in stark violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 1-7) for bid rigging and price fixing, and Idaho Code Title 45, Chapter 15 for bypassing mandatory public auction procedures.
Evidence: I have substantial evidence, including documented communications and financial transactions, suggesting a premeditated effort to suppress fair market competition for my property.
Unlawful Disclosure and Misuse of Personal Information:

Violation: The trustees' unauthorized disclosure of my personal employment information to BoA constitutes a gross invasion of privacy and potential violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), given its misuse in the foreclosure process.
Evidence: Correspondences indicating the trustees' involvement in sharing sensitive information without my consent.
Intimidation by Local Developer:

Violation: A local developer, in collusion with BoA, attempted to intimidate me into selling my property below market value. This act constitutes coercion and fraud, actionable under both state and federal laws.
Evidence: A recorded conversation with the developer explicitly detailing their collusion with the bank and their intent to intimidate me, alongside the round-robin legal representation scheme aimed at obstructing my ability to secure legal counsel.
Securities Fraud:

Violation: In 2018, I uncovered BoA's engagement in securities fraud, involving the inflation of mortgage numbers to artificially enhance financial performance, directly impacting the foreclosure process of my property.
Evidence: Financial records and mortgage transactions documentation, supplemented by additional evidence such as emails and witness statements, support these allegations.
Request for Immediate Action:
Given the criminal nature of these actions, I request:

Immediate halt to the foreclosure auction scheduled for February 29, 2024.
Comprehensive investigation by the FBI into allegations of collusion, conspiracy, and securities fraud involving BoA, the mentioned developer, and complicit legal professionals.
SEC inquiry into the securities fraud allegations to ensure market integrity and investor protection.
Public awareness through media coverage to prevent further victimization and encourage a transparent investigation.
Conclusion:
The detailed account and available evidence underscore the urgent need for intervention to prevent the consummation of these criminal activities. The implications of these actions extend far beyond my individual case, affecting the integrity of the legal and financial systems at large.

I am prepared to fully cooperate and provide all necessary documentation to support this request. Your prompt and decisive action is crucial in addressing these violations and ensuring accountability for those responsible.

Subject: Immediate Intervention Required to Halt Illegal Foreclosure Auction and Investigate Collusion, Fraud, and Antitrust Violations

To Whom It May Concern,

I am compelled to bring to your immediate attention a series of egregious legal violations surrounding the scheduled foreclosure auction of my property on [Date]. This situation is not merely a civil dispute but involves clear criminal conduct by Bank of America (BoA), certain local developers, and trustees/law firms, necessitating urgent law enforcement intervention.

Critical Points of Concern:

Illegal Foreclosure Auction Scheduled:

Criminal Violations: The upcoming auction is a result of collusion and bid-rigging, involving BoA and local developers. This conduct breaches the Sherman Antitrust Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 1-7), specifically through conspiracy to restrain trade and price fixing. These are felonious acts with potential penalties including imprisonment and substantial fines.
Evidence: I have recorded conversations with a developer who admitted to working in concert with BoA to manipulate the auction process. This recording clearly demonstrates attempts to intimidate me into selling my property below market value, underscoring the coercive and fraudulent nature of their actions.
Trustee and Law Firm Misconduct:

Criminal Violations: The trustees and their associated law firms have engaged in deceptive practices, including the unauthorized sharing of my personal employment information with BoA, indicative of a broader scheme to defraud and disenfranchise me. These actions potentially violate federal wire fraud statutes (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and state laws governing foreclosure and trustee responsibilities.
Evidence: The Servicing Disclosure Statement from Zions First National Bank N.A., highlighting procedural discrepancies and unauthorized information sharing​​.
Collusion and Intimidation by Developers:

Criminal Violations: The explicit attempt by a local developer to scare me into selling my property, as recorded, violates Idaho's statutes against coercion and fraud, alongside federal antitrust laws.
Evidence: A detailed account and timestamped recording of the developer admitting collusion with BoA, aiming to manipulate the foreclosure and auction processes​​.
Request for Immediate Action:

Given the detailed evidence of criminal activities, including antitrust violations, fraud, and coercion, I urgently request:

The immediate suspension of the foreclosure auction scheduled for [Date].
A thorough investigation into these allegations against BoA, the involved developers, trustees, and law firms by your office.
Appropriate legal action against the parties involved, reflecting the severity of their criminal conduct.
The evidence at hand not only supports these claims but underscores the imperative for swift intervention to prevent the consummation of these illegal acts. I am prepared to cooperate fully and provide further documentation as required.

I trust your office will recognize the gravity of this situation and act promptly to uphold the law and protect the rights and interests of affected individuals.

Sincerely,

[Your Full Name]

Miss Carter,

Subject: Imperative Legal Notice Concerning Foreclosure Auction Scheduled for 2/29/24

Upon reviewing the notification regarding the beneficiary's decision to proceed with the auction of my property on 2/29/24, it is crucial to articulate the grave legal missteps and potential consequences of such actions. It has come to my attention, supported by substantial documentation, that there has been a series of actions that directly contravene the Sherman Antitrust Act, among other legal statutes, due to clear evidence of collusion, auction fixing, and fraudulent practices surrounding this property.

These documented actions not only expose all involved parties to significant legal liabilities, including, but not limited to, severe penalties under federal law, but also undermine the foundational principles of justice and market fairness. Specifically, these activities could lead to sanctions, including up to 10 years in federal prison and fines reaching up to $1 million for individuals and $100 million for corporations, as stipulated by federal statutes.

The evidence I possess, meticulously compiled and supported by expert analysis, unequivocally substantiates the corrupt practices at play. This includes recorded admissions of malfeasance and fraudulent misrepresentations by the bank and related parties, conclusively demonstrating the illicit nature of this auction. To proceed under these circumstances not only exhibits a blatant disregard for legal obligations but also signifies a deliberate engagement in malfeasance that I am fully prepared to contest through all available legal channels.

I hereby demand an immediate halt to the auction process pending a thorough and comprehensive investigation into these allegations. Ignoring this demand will be perceived as a willful defiance of legal standards and ethics, necessitating my pursuit of all appropriate legal remedies.

This communication serves as a formal notice of the serious legal infractions at play and my intent to seek full accountability for any and all wrongful actions associated with this matter. I anticipate your firm's immediate corrective measures in response to this critical issue.

Your prompt attention to this matter is not only expected but required, as failure to respond appropriately will compel me to initiate further legal action to address this egregious conduct and seek redress for the violations incurred.

Sincerely,

Jeremy Bass





Upon receipt of the notice regarding the beneficiary's decision to advance with the auction of my property on 2/29/24, I must underscore the grave legal oversights and the impending repercussions of such actions. It has become increasingly clear, backed by substantial documentation and prior communications, that there exists a pattern of actions violating the Sherman Antitrust Act and other legal statutes, marked by collusion, auction rigging, and fraudulent practices.

These actions, as documented, expose all involved to significant legal liabilities, including severe penalties under federal law. The activities in question could lead to sanctions, including up to 10 years in federal prison and fines up to $1 million for individuals, and $100 million for corporations.

Furthermore, it is imperative to highlight the imminent injury to any potential buyer due to the misrepresentation of the property. The current portrayal of the property erroneously includes movable outbuildings and omits critical legal aspects that are not part of the sale. Advancing with the auction, given these misrepresented facts, equates to a deliberate act of misrepresentation, knowingly causing harm to any potential buyer. This not only exacerbates the legal violations but also places an additional layer of ethical and legal responsibility on all parties aware of these facts, including your firm, Bank of America, and Carrington.

The evidence I possess, which has been rigorously compiled and supported by expert analysis, unequivocally demonstrates the corrupt practices undermining this auction's integrity. To proceed, knowing these facts, would not only exhibit a blatant disregard for legal obligations but would also be seen as acting with malice intent, which I am fully prepared to contest through all available legal avenues.

Additionally, I have already initiated the process of rectifying the property’s financial and legal standing, as evidenced by my direct payment of the property’s insurance for the current year, in anticipation of a smooth transition towards securing an unclouded title. This action, aligned with a verbal agreement with Carrington, underscores a commitment to address the financial commitments of the property post the probate process for my mother’s estate. With the court date for finalizing matters scheduled for February 26, 2024, it is unreasonable and unnecessary to proceed with the auction, thereby violating our agreement recognized as binding under Idaho Statute 29-105.

I hereby demand an immediate cessation of the auction process pending a comprehensive investigation into these allegations and the rectification of the property's misrepresentation. This communication serves as a formal notice of the severe legal infractions at play and my intent to seek full accountability for any wrongful actions associated with this matter. Immediate corrective measures are expected in response to this critical issue.

Your prompt and diligent attention to this matter is required, and I look forward to your firm's cooperative action to resolve these pressing concerns.

Sincerely,

Jeremy Bass









Miss Carter,

Subject: Imperative Legal Notice and Demand for Auction Cessation Scheduled for 2/29/24

Upon receiving your notice regarding the beneficiary's decision to proceed with the auction of my property on 2/29/24,  I must underscore the grave legal oversights and the impending repercussions of such actions. This decision blatantly disregards the alerts from prior communications, which have elucidated a series of actions in direct violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act and other legal statutes, marked by collusion, auction rigging, and fraudulent practices.

These documented actions pose significant legal liabilities to all involved parties, which could include severe penalties under federal law, sanctions, including up to 10 years in federal prison, and fines up to $1 million for individuals and $100 million for corporations, just for starters regarding the auction itself. Moreover, it is imperative to highlight the imminent injury to any potential buyer due to the misrepresentation of the property. The current portrayal includes movable outbuildings and overlooks critical legal aspects not part of the sale. Proceeding under these misrepresented facts constitutes a deliberate act of deception, causing potential harm to buyers and placing additional ethical and legal responsibilities on all aware parties, the trustees (including your firm), Bank of America, and Carrington.

The evidence I possess, meticulously compiled and supported by expert analysis, unequivocally demonstrates the corrupt practices at play in undermining this auction's integrity. Advancing with the auction, fully aware of these details, would not only exhibit a blatant disregard for legal obligations but would also be seen as acting with malice intent, which I am fully prepared to contest through all available legal avenues.

Furthermore, we have already initiated the process of rectifying the property’s financial and legal standing, evidenced by Carrington not paying the property’s insurance for the current year out of escrow, but instead having me make the direct payment the current year. This action, aligned with a verbal agreement with Carrington, signifies a commitment to resolving the outstanding issues in good faith after the probate process for my mother’s estate, which is scheduled for a court date on February 26, 2024. Such agreements, recognized as binding under Idaho Statute 29-105, underscore the unjustifiable nature of proceeding with the auction. In short, they don't have the right to resend the hold as we are in process already as agreed and proven via actions.

I hereby demand an immediate halt to the auction process pending a thorough investigation into these allegations and the correction of the property's misrepresentation. Ignoring this demand will be perceived as a willful defiance of legal standards and ethics, necessitating my pursuit of all appropriate legal remedies. This communication serves as a formal notice of the severe legal infractions at play and my intent to seek full accountability for any wrongful actions associated with this matter.

Immediate corrective measures are expected in response to these pressing issues. Your prompt and diligent attention to this matter is required. I anticipate your firm's cooperative action to address and resolve these concerns promptly.

Sincerely,

Jeremy Bass

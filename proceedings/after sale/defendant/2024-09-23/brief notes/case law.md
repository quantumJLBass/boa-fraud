## for rescinded trustee's sale due to foreclosure on the wrong instrument
In the case of Kempton-Baughman v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. , the trustee's sale was rescinded due to the foreclosure being conducted using the wrong instrument. Specifically, the foreclosure sale was conducted in error because UBS Investment Bank, the entity to which the property was sold, was a nonentity. The trustee recorded a "Notice of Rescission of Trustee's Deed Upon Sale," stating that the sale was conducted in error due to a failure to communicate timely notice of conditions that would have warranted a cancellation of the foreclosure [Kempton-Baughman v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 162 Idaho 174](https://plus.lexis.com/document?pddocfullpath=%2fshared%2fdocument%2fcases%2furn%3acontentItem%3a5NMR-MDG1-F04G-1022-00000-00&pdmfid=1530671&pdcontentcomponentid=6649&pdproductcontenttypeid=urn:pct:30&pdisdoclinkaccess=true&pdischatbotdoc=true).  
  
Another relevant case is Edwards v. Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys. , where the trustee's sale was rescinded. In this case, the beneficiary decided to rescind the sale, and a notice of the rescission of the trustee's deed was recorded to return the priority and existence of all title and lienholders to the status quo ante as existed prior to the Trustee's Sale. This rescission was done to address issues related to the ownership and proper execution of the foreclosure documents [Edwards v. Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., 154 Idaho 511](https://plus.lexis.com/document?pddocfullpath=%2fshared%2fdocument%2fcases%2furn%3acontentItem%3a588K-87N1-F04G-100D-00000-00&pdmfid=1530671&pdcontentcomponentid=6649&pdproductcontenttypeid=urn:pct:30&pdisdoclinkaccess=true&pdischatbotdoc=true).

doctrine of part performance
This doctrine allows for the enforcement of an oral contract when one party has taken significant actions in reliance on the agreement, such as paying property taxes and insurance, which substantiate the existence and terms of the agreement. The Idaho courts have recognized that part performance can remove a contract from the statute of frauds, thereby making it enforceable.




In Hinkle v. Winey, the Idaho Court of Appeals affirmed that an oral contract for the sale of land is generally unenforceable under Idaho Code §§ 9-503 and 9-505(5). However, an exception exists where the party seeking enforcement can show part performance consistent with the asserted contract. The court emphasized that the partial performance must be solely referable to the existence of the contract and not explainable by any other purpose or arrangement [Hinkle v. Winey, 126 Idaho 993](https://plus.lexis.com/document?pddocfullpath=%2fshared%2fdocument%2fcases%2furn%3acontentItem%3a3RX4-2SW0-003D-33PD-00000-00&pdmfid=1530671&pdcontentcomponentid=6647&pdproductcontenttypeid=urn:pct:30&pdisdoclinkaccess=true&pdischatbotdoc=true).

A tort claim against the city of Lewiston alleging $825,000 in damages has been filed by Kim and Glenda Morlan, whose home just outside the city limits burned to a pile of rubble Nov. 18.

Lewiston firefighters were on the scene, but didn't fight the fire.

The claim, which can be a precursor to a lawsuit, was filed Wednesday with City Clerk Rebecca Hubbard. It has been turned over to the city's insurance company, which has 180 days to respond, Hubbard said.

A fire inspector said shortly after the destruction that the fire started inside a wall of a shop building separated from the house at 3904 21st St., probably from an electrical source.

Flames spread to the house and efforts by water trucks from McGregor Co. and Keatts Seed Co. likely prevented it from spreading into other nearby homes on the Nez Perce County side of the city limits.

The Morlans didn't have any insurance on the home. They previously had contracted with the city of Lewiston for fire protection but that had been canceled.

The tort claim says city fire trucks and firefighters arrived at the scene and after making sure the house was outside the city and no one was inside, pulled back but remained nearby for 20 to 25 minutes.

"Because they appeared to be present to render aid, others who would have rendered aid did not render aid or were delayed from rendering aid causing and resulting in claimants being damaged," says the tort claim.

Kim Morlan and four of his employees who had been working on a house under construction down the street from the fire were using a hose to try to contain the fire to the shop when firefighters arrived.

"As soon as the City Fire Department arrived all of these individuals put their hoses down believing the city was there to help fight the fire. By the time the city decided that it was not going to fight the fire, it was too late to resume the attempt to contain the fire," the tort claim says.

A McGregor employee was behind the fire trucks with a cellular telephone and would have called sooner for his company water truck except that he thought the city would fight the fire.

Two city fire inspectors arrived after the fire was out, saying they were insured while on the scene because the sheriff had asked for their help in determining the cause of the fire.

The sheriff said he had asked the firefighters to fight the fire too, the Morlans say.

They claim the city provided fire protection for them until the service was terminated without cause in 1997 or early 1998. They say the city has fought other fires outside the city limits, including on Lewiston Hill, and the decision not to fight the Morlans' fire was "arbitrary and capricious."

Damages claimed include the $275,000 value of the family home, $50,000 for personal property and furnishings and $500,000 for extreme emotional distress.

The Morlans are represented by James W. Grow Jr. of the Lewiston law firm of Grow and Arnold.

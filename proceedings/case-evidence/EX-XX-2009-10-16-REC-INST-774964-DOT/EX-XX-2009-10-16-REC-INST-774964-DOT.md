## Relevance to the Case

### What is Noteworthy
1. **Chain of Title Break**:
   - The **Letter of Full Reconveyance**, recorded on **November 10, 2009**, confirmed satisfaction of the prior loan. This Deed of Trust introduces a new obligation, breaking the title chain and raising compliance issues with Idaho property law.
   
2. **Timing and Jurisdiction Discrepancies**:
   - The notarization occurred on **October 23, 2009**, in **Nez Perce County, Idaho**, but was recorded seven days later on **October 30, 2009**. This timing overlap conflicts with the reconveyance timeline.

3. **Signature Issues**:
   - The borrower's signature on this document does not match verified authentic signatures. Inconsistent "same day" signatures on related documents further suggest forgery.

4. **Unexplained Loan Funds**:
   - The loan amount of **$148,614.00** has no documented application toward pre-existing debts or disbursement to the borrower, suggesting fabrication.

---

## The Point
This document introduces a fraudulent lien on the property, breaking the title chain and providing an illegitimate basis for foreclosure. Its irregularities—timing, unexplained funds, and mismatched signatures—support allegations of fraud.

---

## Why It's Important
1. **Invalid Foreclosure Basis**:
   - With the reconveyance confirming prior debt satisfaction, this new loan and lien lack validity.
   
2. **Evidence of Forgery**:
   - Signature discrepancies and unexplained financials directly implicate the involved parties in systemic fraud.

3. **Statutory Violations**:
   - The document's timeline disrupts compliance with Idaho Code § 45-1506 and federal FHA regulations.

---

## Links to Other Exhibits and Evidence
1. **Exhibit R (Letter of Full Reconveyance)**:
   - Confirms the prior loan was fully satisfied and the property was free of liens.
2. **Exhibit U (Original Deed of Trust)**:
   - Provides the initial lien and terms, offering a baseline for detecting discrepancies.
3. **Affidavit on Signature Discrepancies**:
   - Highlights the inconsistencies in borrower signatures and their implications.

---

## Dates to Highlight
- **Execution Date**: October 16, 2009
- **Notarization Date**: October 23, 2009
- **Recording Date**: October 30, 2009
- **Reconveyance Date**: November 10, 2009
- **Loan Maturity Date**: November 1, 2039

---

## In the Grand Scheme
1. **Undermining Foreclosure Actions**:
   - This exhibit demonstrates that the foreclosure was based on a fraudulent instrument, disrupting the title chain.
2. **Pattern of Fraud**:
   - Aligns with systemic practices tied to MERS, BoA, and Alliance Title, including document tampering and forgery.
3. **Proof of Misconduct**:
   - Highlights the parties' intent to defraud [[BASS, JEREMY L|JEREMY L. BASS]].

*G. Morlan* **(5/19/23, 8:16 PM):**
so, would you be willing to work with
me on your home, I would be
interested in buying it,.

*J. Bass* **(5/20/23, 7:19 AM):**
I don't know who you are

You can now message and call each other and see info
like Active Status and when you've read messages.

*G. Morlan* **(5/20/23, 7:19 AM):**
I found your home on a foreclosure
aution site, would you like to work out
a deal?

*G. Morlan* **(5/20/23, 7:19 AM):**
I live here in lewiston.

*G. Morlan* **(5/20/23, 7:51 AM):**
I could sit down and talk to you about
it.

*G. Morlan* **(6/2/23, 12:30 PM):**
You realize you only have 20 days left
before they aution off your house?
The mortgage company will buy
it..and then add on tons of expenses
onto of the mortgage and then aution
it off again to recap all expenses.
However, right after they buy it at the
first auction, they will do a Sheriff's
eviction, that will only give you 30
minutes to get as much as you can
out of the house. They will change the
locks and issue you a restraining order
to stay away from the property. Call
me I will try to help you, cause at this
point your between a rock and hard
place. Not easy. 208 553 8303

*J. Bass* **(6/2/23, 12:49 PM):**
You don't want the truths

*G. Morlan* **(6/2/23, 12:50 PM):**
Try me, I have 30 years of real estate
experience been there done that.

*G. Morlan* **(6/2/23, 12:50 PM):**
Right now, your only chance to get out
without a foreclosure (that can stay on
your credit for up to 1 0 years) and to
walk away with funds is to do a quick
sell and because of time it will have to
be cash.

*G. Morlan* **(6/2/23, 12:52 PM):**
Right now because the bank has thier
law firm in charge of your mortgage it
is accumulating extra fees on top of
penalties and late payments. All this
is out of your control and unless you
have the cash to bring it all current
along with the other fees, it's a done
deal, and believe me they have no pitty
for you as a customer.

*J. Bass* **(6/2/23, 1:14 PM):**
I do see that the sell was for Dec
right. I am sorry but I am fighting
for everyone else. I know I could
have sold the house and took the
easy way out. I wasnt behind on
payments. I didn't do anything
more then say no, you committed
mass fraud, I have mounds of
evidence and I will not pay you for
committing a crime. I you recall
what Wells Fargo was caught doing
that brought them to task a few
years ago, think that but with home
loans. The bank should not grt to
commit crimes and then make the
victims pay them too.

*G. Morlan* **(6/2/23, 1:14 PM):**
Not Dec. Your house is on auction
June 22 2023 county court house

*G. Morlan* **(6/2/23, 1:14 PM):**
Idea law group is in control of the
foreclosure

*J. Bass* **(6/2/23, 1:14 PM):**
They have been postponing it since
Dec because I am in suit with them

*G. Morlan* **(6/2/23, 1:14 PM):**
You can fight the fight, but right now
they are going to win, and you will be
homeless, under cut them first..so you
can fight them. Tell me how are you
going to move your stuff out with the
sheriff eviction? Because at that point
the law is on thier side. You'll only
have 30 minutes.

*J. Bass* **(6/2/23, 1:14 PM):**
Why would you say they would win.

*G. Morlan* **(6/2/23, 1:41 PM):**
Because your original mortgage
contract at the closing spells out that
once they have filed all paper work for
a foreclosure you either have to pay all
fees and penalties along with late
payments before the week of the
auction or you forfeit to the auction,
believe me it's on your contract small
print and you didn't even read it. So
you gave them the upper hand to
foreclose just after 3 missed
payments. Trust me no one reads it at
closing, however you will have up to
180 days to pay the same amount that
the auction brings in to cover the
mortgage, auction fee, law fees, title
fees, and sheriffs eviction, utilities and
other that is paid for, however this is
an Idaho law that I believe you signed
away on your original contract with the
mortgage owner.

*J. Bass* **(6/2/23, 1:41 PM):**
they voided the conteact when they
forged my signature and create a
brand new deed of trust when they
bought the loan. i don't have a valid
contract with them

*J. Bass* **(6/2/23, 1:41 PM):**

attempt to crowd source legal action for
the good of the country

*G. Morlan* **(6/2/23, 1:41 PM):**
This is a general practice on mortgage
contracts set up so the mortgage
company doesnt lose money.

*J. Bass* **(6/2/23, 1:41 PM):**
i will not let them be rewarded for
committing crimes by getting the
house or another payment. it
should bother everyone that they
where doing that they did

with the court.

(plaintiff/docs/filed-2023-03-30 ..
that is the last of them.. and in
there is each of the current
paperwork. and the last filing with
the postponement
https://github.com/quantumJLBass/boa-fraud/tree/main/case/plaintiff/docs/2023-04-25 cause BOA did me a favor a
proved that the Carrington servicing
was not in play till 2017 showing
that them trying to have the
paperwork for 2012 with their name
on it if a attempt at forging
paperwork making me a party to
the crime which is why i wouldn't
sign it in 2021 for papers dated
2012. this is the evidence pack
https://qithub.com/quantumJLBass/boa-fraud/tree/main/case/plaintiff/evidence/exhibits/—BlN and what may make
it clear is this timeline here..

https://github.com/quantumJLBass/boa-fraud/blob/main/case/plaintiff/evidence-outline.pdf

have some updates to it now to
make but it getts the point. i will be
done with my phone call in a like 15
mins, but thank you

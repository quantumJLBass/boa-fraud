In exercising its discretion with regard to the amendment of pleadings, "a court
must be guided by the underlying purpose of Rule 15--to facilitate a decision on the
merits rather than on the pleadings or technicalities." United States v. Webb, 655 F.2d
977, 979 (9th Cir. 1981). Indeed, the "Supreme Court has instructed the lower federal
courts to heed carefully the command of Rule 15(a), Fed.R.Civ.P., by freely granting
leave to amend when justice so requires.'" Gabrielson v. Montgomery Ward & Co., 785
F.2d 762, 765 (9th Cir. 1986) (quoting Howey v. United States, 481 F.2d 1187, 1190 (9th
Cir. 1973)).
Leave to amend should be granted even more liberally to pro se plaintiffs. Lira v.
Herrera, 427 F.3d 1164, 1176 (9th Cir. 2005) (quoting Ramirez v. Galaza, 334 F.3d 850,
861 (9th Cir. 2003)). Pro se plaintiffs should be given the opportunity to amend their
complaints if they have stated a plausible cause of action. See for example, Akao v.
Shimoda, 832 F.2d 119, 120 (9th Cir. 1987) ("It is true that the prisoners' allegations are
not sufficiently specific and do not allege that they personally have suffered cruel or
inhuman punishment, but we cannot hold that it is 'beyond doubt' that they could not do
so. Therefore, we reverse and remand for the district court to allow the prisoners to file
an amendment"). Accordingly, leave to amend should be granted to pro se plaintiffs
"unless the pleading 'could not possibly be cured by the allegation of other facts.'" Lira
v. Herrera, 427 F.3d at 1176 (quoting Ramirez v. Galaza, 334 F.3d at 861).
Nonetheless, a complaint must contain "a short and plaint statement of the claim
showing that the pleader is entitled to relief . . . ." Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). Detailed factual
allegations are not required, but "[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,
supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S.
662, __, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (citing Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.
544, 555 (2007)). Plaintiff must set forth "sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to
'state a claim that is plausible on its face.'" Id. Facial plausibility demands more than the
mere possibility that a defendant committed misconduct and, while factual allegations are accepted as true, legal
conclusions are not. Id. at 1949-50.

In each of the claims Plaintiff sets forth in his request for leave to amend, Plaintiff
makes certain allegations against "known and unknown parties." Plaintiff appears to be
trying to add Doe Defendants. The use of Doe Defendants is not favored in the Ninth Circuit.
 See Gillespie v. Civiletti, 629 F.2d 637, 642 (9thCir. 1980). However, where the
identity of alleged defendants cannot be known prior to the filing of a complaint the
plaintiff should be given an opportunity through discovery to identify them. Id. Failure
to afford the plaintiff such an opportunity is error. See Wakefield v. Thompson, 177 F.3d
1160, 1163 (9th Cir. 1999)

Motion for Reconsideration

DEMAND FOR JURY

COMES NOW the Plaintiff, JEREMY L. BASS, and respectfully moves this Court to reconsider its Order on Motions for Reconsideration dated March 9, 2023, which denied Plaintiff's Request for a Temporary Restraining Order and Motion for Reconsideration. As grounds for this request, the Plaintiff respectfully asks the Court to review the following arguments and legal authorities in support of the Plaintiff's request.

The Court found that Plaintiff's motion did not adequately comply with the requirements set forth in I.R.C.P. 65. In response, the Plaintiff submits that they have now met the requirements of I.R.C.P. 65 by providing additional details on the timelines and identifying a new party, ReconTrust Company, N.A., in their proposed amended complaint.

In light of the new facts and the urgency of the situation, as the sale is scheduled for tomorrow, the Plaintiff asks the Court to grant this Motion for Reconsideration and allow the Plaintiff to amend the complaint, thereby providing a fair opportunity for the Plaintiff to present their case and protect their rights.

The Plaintiff acknowledges the challenge of proceeding pro se due to a lack of access to legal representation stemming from conflicts of interest with local law firms practicing real estate or contract law. Despite the inherent disadvantage faced by the Plaintiff, they are dedicated to meeting the Court's expectations and ensuring procedural compliance.

The Plaintiff would also like to highlight the vast disparity in litigation capacity between a pro se litigant and a practicing attorney, emphasizing the inherent inequity that tends to favor the more affluent. The Plaintiff's extensive self-guided research, while commendable, pales in comparison to the education and experience of a professional attorney, and this serves as a reminder of the handicaps faced by those compelled to represent themselves.

In accordance with the underlying purpose of Rule 15—to facilitate a decision on the merits rather than on the pleadings or technicalities—this Court should exercise its discretion to allow the amendment of the complaint. The Ninth Circuit has directed lower federal courts to carefully heed the command of Rule 15(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, by freely granting leave to amend when justice so requires (Gabrielson v. Montgomery Ward & Co., 785 F.2d 762, 765 (9th Cir. 1986)).

Pro se plaintiffs should be granted even more liberal leave to amend their pleadings (Lira v. Herrera, 427 F.3d 1164, 1176 (9th Cir. 2005)). As long as the Plaintiff has stated a plausible cause of action, they should be given the opportunity to amend their complaint (Akao v. Shimoda, 832 F.2d 119, 120 (9th Cir. 1987)). Leave to amend should only be denied if the pleading could not possibly be cured by the allegation of other facts (L

Moving to a new state is stressful. New customs, new laws, new people along with buying a home is challenging. I was fortunate to have an experienced realtor who pointed me to C and F mortgage in my home buying process. Nancy was my guide through the mortgage process and I am very grateful for her knowledge, professionalism, and kindness. She always made herself available for questions and her explanations were thorough and understandable. I can honestly say it was a pleasure to use C and F mortgage for my home buying experience. Thank you all at C and F!

As a real estate broker, I have dealt with many lenders in the past. I can tell you Nancy Poteat and Linda are one of the best lenders you will ever find. I recently used them to obtain a VA loan for my own home purchase.  They have a reputation of excellence so when placing an offer for a VA loan, and the other agent knows Nancy is involved,  it makes life much easier and more apt to negotiate and get accepted.  She closed our loan quickly and painlessly.  Such a fantastic experience.  Highly recommend! You won't be disappointed.

I worked with C&F for my home purchase loan. They were kind, knowledgeable, understanding, and extremely helpful. I got a much better rate than going with Rocket Mortgage and I am so happy that I found a local company to support. They welcomed me into the community and made my move as smooth as possible. Nancy was great, so smart & always available to answer my many questions. I could not be happier with their service!

She was great and very attentive the first time I spoke with her. She gave me so much hope that I would be able to purchase a house for me and my son. After I submitted all of my information to Nancy, she reviewed everything and she informed me that there were some problems that was preventing me from moving forward with obtaining a pre-approval. From that day she stopped returning my emails and she never returned any of calls.

I had many questions as to what I needed to do in order to move forward with being able to obtain a pre-approval but this individual never answered any of my questions.

I do understand she is extremely busy but had she taken the time to help me out and to help me figure out a solution to my financial problem she would've been able to help me obtain a pre-approval.

If Nancy didn't have the time to help me then the least she could've done was to refer me to someone else or she could've simply told me that she couldn't help me.

I wasted so much of my precious time waiting for Nancy to get back to me that I've missed out on such great houses for me and my son.

Thankfully I was able to obtain a pre-approval letter with another lender who took the time to help me and I'm less than a month away from closing on my first home.

I do wish Nancy nothing but the best but please don't make another person waste their time especially when they're a single mother trying to find a place for her and her child(ren) to call their own.

Nancy and Linda are WONDERFUL!!!! They were so sweet and helpful throughout the whole loan process. I could not have asked for better service. I was a first time home buyer and any questions I had they were willing to answer. I highly recommend C&F Mortgage!!

I was with another lender that piled a bunch home repairs one week before closing. The repairs should have been stated weeks before closing from the appraisal report. It was just a mess. Swapped lenders and worked with Nancy at C&F and we closed ten days from the original closing date with no nonsense superficial repairs needed. C&F Mortgage put me in the home of my dreams without letting it slip away.

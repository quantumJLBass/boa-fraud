            5             MS. RICHMOND:  Our next case for today is 

            6    item B1 Bank of America Corporation and its 

            7    Affiliates.  

            8             And this case has been granted an extra 

            9    five minutes for the opening presentation.  

           10             MS. HARKEY:  Thank you very much.  

           11             Mr. Epolite, will you please introduce the 

           12    issues of this case.  

           13             MR. THOMPSON:  Good afternoon.  It's 

           14    actually Grant Thompson for the Appeals Bureau.  

           15             MS. HARKEY:  Grant, I'm sorry.  

           16             MR. THOMPSON:  That's okay.  

           17             MS. HARKEY:  I'm on auto pilot, so excuse 

           18    me, Grant.  

           19             MR. THOMPSON:  Unless I say something 

           20    stupid, then in which case it's Anthony.  

           21             MS. HARKEY:  You can blame him.  You can 

           22    blame him.  It's his fault, right?  

           23             MR. THOMPSON:  Just one issue today, which 

           24    is whether dividend income received by appellant 

           25    from China Construction Bank constitutes business 

           26    income.  

           27             MS. HARKEY:  Thank you.  All right.  

           28             MR. BRANNAN:  Good afternoon, Madam 




                                                                     3




                                                                      


            1    Chairwoman and Members of the Board.  

            2             MS. HARKEY:  I guess you know the routine.  

            3             MR. BRANNAN:  I -- I do.  I'm sorry.  I'm 

            4    just anxious about the time.

            5             MS. HARKEY:  Thank you so much.  

            6             MR. BRANNAN:  I don't want to miss those 

            7    few seconds at the beginning.  

            8             MS. HARKEY:  Go ahead.  You will not -- you 

            9    can go.

           10             MR. BRANNAN:  We're good.  Thank you.  

           11             Good afternoon, Madam Chairwoman and 

           12    Members of the Board.  Thanks for your time this 

           13    afternoon.  

           14             I'm Derick Brannan from 

           15    PricewaterhouseCoopers.  Immediately to my right is 

           16    Jon Sperring, also from PwC.  And to my left is Ms. 

           17    Karen Mirandi, the State Tax Director from Bank of 

           18    America.  

           19             I'm going to ask Ms. Mirandi to 

           20    introduce -- we have three witnesses today, and 

           21    she'll introduce those speakers, the remaining 

           22    members of our team.  

           23             MS. MIRANDI:  David Belk is a Senior VP at 

           24    Bank of America with 22 years of experience.  He's 

           25    an executive on our global corporate strategy team, 

           26    which manages our company investments and 

           27    divestitures.  And he participated in the due 

           28    diligence prior to our investment in China 




                                                                     4




                                                                      


            1    Construction Bank or CCB.  

            2             Behind me is Lauren Hood.  Lauren is also a 

            3    Senior VP with 23 years of experience at the 

            4    company.  Most importantly, she was the bank 

            5    executive that was charged with the execution of the 

            6    CCB's Strategic Assistance Agreement in 2008 to 

            7    2013.  

            8             And then also behind me is Larry Smilie.  

            9    Mr. Smilie is a Managing Director with over 30 years 

           10    of experience in our global leasing division.  He is 

           11    responsible for corporate, commercial and business 

           12    leasing originations, as well as leasing 

           13    syndications in the United States, and he also 

           14    participated in the due diligence related to the 

           15    leasing JV with CCB.  

           16             MS. HARKEY:  Thank you.  

           17             MR. BRANNAN:  The issue before the Board 

           18    today is whether income from a minority investment 

           19    and a bank owned and controlled by the Chinese 

           20    government can give rise to a portionable business 

           21    income.  The answer is a resounding no.  

           22             The facts are straightforward.  Bank of 

           23    America or BAC exchanged expertise in capital for an 

           24    opportunity to invest in the fastest growing economy 

           25    in the world at that time.  As part of the 

           26    transaction, the Chinese government and CCB imposed 

           27    multiple restrictions on BAC's investment.  Those 

           28    limitations prevented the investment from ever 




                                                                     5




                                                                      


            1    becoming a integral part of BAC's trade or business, 

            2    and therefore income from the investment is 

            3    nonbusiness income.  

            4             The law is clear.  And I'll ask the Board 

            5    Members to look at the first page of the exhibits 

            6    that we handed out.  Specifically, California 

            7    Revenue and Taxation Code section 25120 provides 

            8    that income from property is business income.  The 

            9    acquisition, management and disposition of the 

           10    property constitute integral parts of the taxpayer's 

           11    trade or business.  

           12             MR. RUNNER:  Hang on just a minute.  

           13             MR. BRANNAN:  Yes, sir.  

           14             MS. HARKEY:  You don't have yours?  

           15             MR. RUNNER:  I'm missing a -- it's right 

           16    where?  

           17             Oh, here it is.  I got it.  I'm good.  

           18             MS. HARKEY:  There you go.  He's in 

           19    business now.  

           20             MR. RUNNER:  I got it now.  

           21             MR. BRANNAN:  Thank you.  So that's just 

           22    page 1.  

           23             Page 2, in Hoechst Celanese, the California 

           24    Supreme Court set forth the standard for determining 

           25    whether property is integral to a trade or business 

           26    and whether income from that property should be 

           27    treated as apportionable business income under 

           28    California law.  




                                                                     6




                                                                      


            1             And the provisions of that case are so 

            2    important I'm simply going to read from the slide 

            3    for emphasis, and you'll see some underlined 

            4    portions of the language from the case.  

            5                 "Income from the property is business 

            6             income when the property is so interwoven 

            7             into the fabric of the taxpayer's business 

            8             operations that it becomes indivisible or 

            9             inseparable from the taxpayer's business 

           10             activities with both giving value to each 

           11             other."  

           12             We call that the two-way flow of value.  

           13                 "Such a relationship exists when the 

           14             taxpayer controls and uses the property to 

           15             contribute materially to the taxpayer's 

           16             production of business income."  

           17             Consistent with that articulation of the 

           18    task, BAC's investment in CCB must be so interwoven 

           19    into the fabric of BAC's business operations that it 

           20    was indivisible or inseparable from BAC's trade or 

           21    business, with both BAC and CCB giving value to each 

           22    other.  And further, BAC must have controlled and 

           23    used the CCB investment to contribute materially to 

           24    BAC's production and business income.  

           25             Now the facts are pretty straightforward as 

           26    well.  In the early 2000s the Chinese government 

           27    recognized that its four state-owned national banks, 

           28    including CCB, had historically made loans based on 




                                                                     7




                                                                      


            1    a customer's ties to the Chinese government and not 

            2    based on the more modern risk and loan assessment 

            3    practices.  

            4             Those loans were going bad at an alarming 

            5    rate, as high as 30 percent in one of the banks, and 

            6    threatened the integrity of the Chinese financial 

            7    system.  The government needed both expertise and 

            8    capital to modernize and stabilize its banks.  In 

            9    order to accomplish those goals, the government 

           10    allowed CCB to go public, a dramatic gesture in 

           11    China, and sell an equity interest to a 

           12    knowledgeable investor.  

           13             Enter Bank of America in 2005.  Bank of 

           14    America, BAC, acquired -- agreed to acquire a 10 

           15    percent equity interest in CCB.  As part of the 

           16    agreement, BAC agreed to provide strategic 

           17    assistance to CCB to help modernize its banking 

           18    systems.  Through its equity ownership, Bank of 

           19    America sought to profit from the Chinese economy.  

           20    And aside from the failed effort to enter into a 

           21    credit card joint venture, BAC evidenced no desire 

           22    to gain operational value from the investment when 

           23    it joined or when it made the initial equity 

           24    investment.  

           25             The investment carried any number of 

           26    practical and contractual limitations with regard to 

           27    BAC.  For example, following the initial investment, 

           28    BAC had one seat on the CCB Board of Directors and 




                                                                     8




                                                                      


            1    no employees at CCB.  In contrast, the Chinese 

            2    government owned roughly 70 percent of CCB, held the 

            3    remaining 14 to 18 Board of Director seats and 

            4    controlled CCB's Board of Supervisors and all senior 

            5    management at CCB.  

            6             The contracts executed as part of the 

            7    investment further limited BAC's ability to exert 

            8    control over any aspect of CCB or otherwise generate 

            9    operational value from the investment.  

           10             By contract, CCB maintained absolute 

           11    responsibility for making its own management 

           12    decisions concerning operations.  

           13             By contract, BAC had deceased all retail 

           14    banking operations in China as long as it held its 

           15    investment.  

           16             By contract, BAC could only maintain 

           17    corporate offices in China that were necessary to 

           18    support its existing corporate clients, thus 

           19    limiting BAC's ability to expand its corporate 

           20    client base in China.  

           21             By contract, any information learned about 

           22    CCB while providing services as part of the 

           23    Strategic Assistance Agreement could only be used to 

           24    benefit CCB, not BAC.  

           25             By contract, BAC was required to gain CCB's 

           26    approval for the content of its press releases.  

           27             By content -- excuse me -- by contract, BAC 

           28    could not compete with CCB for business in China so 




                                                                     9




                                                                      


            1    long as it held the investment.  

            2             By contract -- there's a theme here -- the 

            3    contracts govern the interaction of the two parties 

            4    in this investment relationship.  

            5             By contract, neither BAC nor CCB could act 

            6    on the behalf of the other or otherwise bind the 

            7    party contractually.  

            8             By contract, BAC and CCB did not have any 

            9    common employees.  

           10             By contract, BAC needed permission from CCB 

           11    to sell its investment at any time during a 

           12    three-year lockup period immediately following the 

           13    acquisition of the equity interest.  

           14             Based on all of these limitations, the CCB 

           15    investment could not and did not become an integral 

           16    part of BAC's trade or business.  

           17             So what I'd like to do now is turn to 

           18    Mr. David Belk, our first witness here.  And, 

           19    Mr. Belk, you were involved in the due diligence in 

           20    the initial Bank of America effort to look at the 

           21    investment in CCB; is that correct?  

           22             MR. BELK:  That's correct.  

           23             MR. BRANNAN:  And why did BAC make the 

           24    investment?  

           25             MR. BELK:  We saw growth opportunity in the 

           26    Chinese economy, and we saw an investment in CCB as 

           27    a mechanism to take advantage of that economic 

           28    growth in China in exchange for strategic assistance 




                                                                    10




                                                                      


            1    on our part.  

            2             MR. BRANNAN:  Could BAC gain much from CCB 

            3    from an operational standpoint?  

            4             MR. BELK:  Not really.  CCB at the time had 

            5    a fairly rudimentary banking operation; they were 

            6    years behind, you know, an equivalent international 

            7    bank.  And that's part of what they were after in 

            8    this investment is to learn and better their banking 

            9    operations.  

           10             MR. BRANNAN:  Did BAC expect to conduct any 

           11    joint business operations with CCB when it made the 

           12    initial investment?  

           13             MR. BELK:  At the time of the initial 

           14    investment, there was hope to do a credit card 

           15    venture with CCB, but the fact of the matter is that 

           16    Chinese law prevented that from happening.  

           17             There was an MOU that was entered around 

           18    the credit card joint venture, but the Chinese 

           19    government never changed the law.  Ultimately, the 

           20    MOU was unwound and nothing ever came of it.  

           21             MR. BRANNAN:  Now at some point during the 

           22    investment relationship BAC and CCB agreed to kind 

           23    of reciprocal free usage of their ATMs.  Can you 

           24    talk about that, please?  

           25             MR. BELK:  That's correct.  There was a 

           26    reciprocal ATM agreement in place.  It was not 

           27    unlike many other agreements that we have or had 

           28    with other international banks all around the world.  




                                                                    11




                                                                      


            1    The terms were identical.  It was something that was 

            2    quite easy for us to do and quite standard with 

            3    other financial institutions where we didn't have an 

            4    investment interest.  

            5             MR. BRANNAN:  How would, uh -- how would 

            6    you expect, I mean, the BAC/CCB ATM arrangement to 

            7    impact BAC?  

            8             MR. BELK:  Well, from BAC's perspective to 

            9    the extent we were waiving service charges either 

           10    from our customers or China Construction Bank's 

           11    customers, then that was an opportunity missed from 

           12    a revenue perspective.  But then on the flipside our 

           13    customers certainly, to the extent they were using 

           14    the ATMs and were avoiding those charges, would 

           15    benefit from that.  

           16             MR. BRANNAN:  Now according to some of the 

           17    press releases that have been discussed in this 

           18    proceeding, BAC also had an arrangement with CCB 

           19    that allowed for free wire transfer transactions.  

           20    Can you talk about that, please.  

           21             MR. BELK:  Right.  I understand that to be 

           22    similar to the ATM arrangement.  It was something 

           23    that would have been relatively easy for us to put 

           24    in place.  

           25             My understanding is that CCB wanted us to 

           26    put the wire transfer in place.  We did that as a 

           27    pilot program in certain markets.  It was never a 

           28    broad program; it was only run in a pilot stage, and 




                                                                    12




                                                                      


            1    it was ultimately sunset.  

            2             We looked at some of the data.  We were 

            3    able to look at some data between 2010 and 2013 just 

            4    to compare how the BAC customer used that wire 

            5    transferability relative to the China Construction 

            6    Bank customer, and during that time period there 

            7    were around 1600 Bank of America customers that 

            8    utilized that service.  

            9             And on the flipside there were some 350,000 

           10    China Construction Bank customers that utilized it.  

           11    So, to me, that's sort of an indication, you know, 

           12    they were interested in us providing this for them 

           13    and we did so through the pilot for a period of 

           14    time.  

           15             MR. BRANNAN:  Now, in August and November 

           16    of 2011 BAC sold off the majority of its investment 

           17    interest; why did BAC make that decision?  

           18             MR. BELK:  Well, we were in the height of 

           19    the financial crisis in the United States at that 

           20    time and we were divesting all of our noncore 

           21    investments, and it made sense for us to divest our 

           22    investment in CCB where we had a large gain and 

           23    therefore could generate capital and liquidity.  At 

           24    the same time it was something that we could sell 

           25    that wouldn't really impact our operations.  

           26             MR. BRANNAN:  Okay.  I'd like to move on at 

           27    this point and obviously encourage any questions 

           28    from the Board Members during the open board time.  




                                                                    13




                                                                      


            1    Obviously the witnesses will be available.  

            2             Ms. Lauren Hood.  You know, Ms. Hood, if 

            3    you would, start -- I mean, you were the Strategic 

            4    Assistance Executive from 2011 through '13.  Could 

            5    you describe what your responsibilities were there, 

            6    please?  

            7             MS. HOOD:  Sure.  I was responsible to be 

            8    the liaison between CCB and BAC to execute the 

            9    Strategic Assistance Agreement.  So what that meant 

           10    was, when CCB had requests for us to deliver 

           11    training or assist them in some work that they were 

           12    doing, I found the appropriate expertise on the Bank 

           13    of America side and matched them up and helped 

           14    negotiate what that would look like.  

           15             MR. BRANNAN:  So what was the purpose of 

           16    the Strategic Assistance Agreement?  

           17             MS. HOOD:  It really was to help provide 

           18    CCB with best practices.  As Mr. Belk mentioned, the 

           19    Chinese economy had been closed for about 20 years, 

           20    so the Chinese banking industry was about 20 years 

           21    behind international banking and they were looking 

           22    for advice on how they could accelerate their 

           23    progress.  

           24             MR. BRANNAN:  So how did the Strategic 

           25    Assistance Agreement actually work from your 

           26    perspective?  

           27             MS. HOOD:  So at the end of each calendar 

           28    year CCB would come to me with a list of requests of 




                                                                    14




                                                                      


            1    areas that they would like training in and I would 

            2    identify whether or not we could support that based 

            3    on the personnel that would be required.  It was 

            4    required that we only share public nonproprietary 

            5    information.  So as long as it fit within those two 

            6    requirements, then I would again identify the 

            7    appropriate expertise on the Bank of America side 

            8    and we'd agree on what that would look like 

            9    throughout the following year.  

           10             MR. BRANNAN:  The Strategic Assistance 

           11    Agreement, the original one indicated that BAC was 

           12    to provide 50 employees on an annual basis.  How did 

           13    you work through the math on that?  

           14             MS. HOOD:  We defined an employee as a 

           15    full-time equivalent, so based on hours agreed upon 

           16    on each side of what that looked like.  And part of 

           17    my job was to track the number of hours supported on 

           18    the Bank of America side and add that up to about 50 

           19    each year.  It was really kind of front-loaded 

           20    because at the start when we were creating our 

           21    processes it really took more personnel to support 

           22    it.  

           23             MR. BRANNAN:  And were there any joint 

           24    business efforts that came out of the SAA that 

           25    you're aware of?  

           26             MS. HOOD:  Not that I'm aware of.  

           27             MR. BRANNAN:  What did BAC and its 

           28    employees get from the effort, those that 




                                                                    15




                                                                      


            1    participated in the training exercises?  

            2             MS. HOOD:  Really nothing.  It was a 

            3    one-way exchange of information.  So it was really 

            4    their taking their time to provide that expertise to 

            5    CCB.  

            6             MR. BRANNAN:  Now, in September of 2011, 

            7    shortly after BAC sold, you know, basically a 

            8    meaningful portion of its investment in CCB and BAC 

            9    extended the Strategic Assistance Agreement, why did 

           10    that happen to your knowledge?  

           11             MS. HOOD:  As I understood it, because we 

           12    were making such a substantial sale of our 

           13    investment, it was a show of goodwill.  Both parties 

           14    were interested in having the investment continue to 

           15    be viewed in a positive light.  And in the grand 

           16    scheme of things the investment was rather small, 

           17    less than $5 million a year for us to continue the 

           18    Strategic Assistance Agreement, and so we did.  

           19             MR. BRANNAN:  Okay.  Thank you very much.  

           20             And, again, Ms. Hood is certainly available 

           21    for any further questions that the Board Members 

           22    have.  

           23             Next, I'd like to bring up Mr. Larry 

           24    Smilie.  And he's going to discuss the leasing joint 

           25    venture.  And it's a little with some reluctance 

           26    here that we bring him up and kind of dignify this 

           27    issue, quite frankly.  It's gotten a lot more 

           28    traction, if you will, in some of the briefings and 




                                                                    16




                                                                      


            1    in the hearing summary than what we would have 

            2    expected for something wherein the bank contributed 

            3    a number that was only, you know, five percent to 

            4    the joint venture relative to its entire investment 

            5    in CCB.  But nonetheless, because of the number of 

            6    questions, Mr. Smilie here is going to speak to the, 

            7    uh -- to the leasing joint venture.  

            8             Now you were involved in the due diligence 

            9    that BAC engaged in in connection with this leasing 

           10    JV; is that correct, Mr. Smilie?  

           11             MR. SMILIE:  Yes.  I was involved, like six 

           12    other executives, that went over to Beijing to kind 

           13    of teach them about the U.S. market and we were over 

           14    there to learn about the Chinese market and see how 

           15    it would work with regard to setting up a leasing 

           16    joint venture.  

           17             MR. BRANNAN:  So why did BAC participate in 

           18    the joint venture?  

           19             MR. SMILIE:  Well, my understanding was 

           20    that we had a Bank of America executive on the CCB 

           21    board and CCB strongly asked us to set up a leasing 

           22    joint venture.  So we were basically asked to kind 

           23    of figure out a way to do this and move forward with 

           24    it.  And our primary goals were trying to do this in 

           25    such a way to kind of protect our investment and 

           26    mitigate our risks.  

           27             MR. BRANNAN:  Did you feel like BAC had 

           28    much of a choice to pursue the joint venture at that 




                                                                    17




                                                                      


            1    time?  

            2             MR. SMILIE:  Well, not with regard to what 

            3    we were doing.  We were just instructed to kind of 

            4    go figure it out, you know, and find a way to make 

            5    this work if we could.  

            6             MR. BRANNAN:  Why did CCB decide to pursue 

            7    a leasing joint venture?  

            8             MR. SMILIE:  Well, I think they wanted to 

            9    learn about the leasing business.  The Chinese laws 

           10    had recently changed, allowing the Chinese banks to 

           11    enter into the leasing business, and so they needed 

           12    some expertise to learn about it.  And we're a 

           13    market leader, so we had a staff of people as far 

           14    as, you know, go over there and try to explain and 

           15    figure out, you know, what was available and what 

           16    they could do.  

           17              MR. BRANNAN:  Why would BAC be 

           18    reluctant -- or maybe a better way to phrase the 

           19    question is how would you compare the leasing 

           20    environments between U.S. and even other countries 

           21    globally to what was going on in China at that time?  

           22             MR. SMILIE:  Well, it was a big difference.  

           23    In the U.S. market, you know, the tax and the county 

           24    regimes were well developed.  You have commercial 

           25    law to help protect your -- your collateral.  And 

           26    there's also a very active used equipment market, 

           27    and none of those things existed in China, which 

           28    made it very hard just to move forward.  




                                                                    18




                                                                      


            1             MR. BRANNAN:  What did, uh -- what was 

            2    BAC's primary goal in participating in this leasing 

            3    joint venture?  

            4             MR. SMILIE:  Yeah, as I mentioned, when we 

            5    were trying to set it up, you know, because of the 

            6    environment we were going into, we were very focused 

            7    on protecting our investment and trying to do 

            8    everything we could to mitigate our risk so we could 

            9    get our capital back down the road.  

           10             MR. BRANNAN:  And with respect to BAC's 

           11    actual involvement, how many total employees did CCB 

           12    have relative to the number of employees for BAC?  

           13             MR. SMILIE:  Yeah.  CCB had 60-plus 

           14    employees, and Bank of America had three executives 

           15    over there and one of them was in a senior risk 

           16    role, related to risk.  

           17             MR. BRANNAN:  Do you recall what customers 

           18    the joint venture focused on?  

           19             MR. SMILIE:  Well, it was exclusively 

           20    focused on the CCB clients and a lot of them with 

           21    state-owned entities; and then they had other 

           22    clients that were not state-owned, but they were all 

           23    CCB clients.  

           24             MR. BRANNAN:  So no BAC customers that 

           25    you're aware of?  

           26             MR. SMILIE:  No, no.  

           27             MR. BRANNAN:  Was there any ongoing 

           28    connections with BAC's global leasing operations and 




                                                                    19




                                                                      


            1    the CCB leasing JV?  

            2             MR. SMILIE:  No.  The joint venture was set 

            3    up very much to be a stand-alone entity and focus on 

            4    the Chinese market.  So there was, you know, little 

            5    to no connectivity with regard to other businesses 

            6    around the world.  

            7             MR. BRANNAN:  Now, BAC earned some return 

            8    on the investment from the JV.  How did that compare 

            9    with BAC's leasing business in general?  

           10             MR. SMILIE:  Well, the returns were about 

           11    five percent on our investment and that would've 

           12    compared around a 30 percent investment return in 

           13    the U.S. market.  So, you know, very modest.  And 

           14    also the earnings we actually earned from the joint 

           15    venture would've been less than one percent of our 

           16    global earnings from the leasing business, very 

           17    small.  

           18             MR. BRANNAN:  Why did BAC ultimately exit 

           19    the JV?  I think you exited one year early; is that 

           20    correct?  

           21             MR. SMILIE:  Well, we asked to exit early 

           22    because there was a divergence in the goals of the 

           23    joint venture.  The CCB wanted to grow the business 

           24    dramatically and they were very focused on growing 

           25    fast.  And as I mentioned earlier, we were focused 

           26    on mitigating the risks, so we had diverging 

           27    interests because the faster they were growing we 

           28    felt they were taking risks that were beyond our 




                                                                    20




                                                                      


            1    appetite for risk and so we basically asked to exit 

            2    early as a result.  

            3             MS. RICHMOND:  Time's expired.  

            4             MR. BRANNAN:  If I may, one last question.  

            5             What did BAC learn from the leasing joint 

            6    venture, Mr. Smilie?  

            7             MR. SMILIE:  Actually, little to nothing 

            8    because they were -- you know, there was no leasing 

            9    business over there and we had all the expertise 

           10    when we went over.  

           11             MR. BRANNAN:  Thank you very much.  

           12             MS. HARKEY:  Thank you.  

           13             Okay.  Department, announce yourself for 

           14    the record and you're on.  

           15             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Good morning, Chairwoman 

           16    Harkey and Members of the Board.  My name is Thomas 

           17    Lo Grossman.  Accompanying me is Craig Swieso.  

           18    Together we are representing the Franchise Tax Board 

           19    in this appeal.  

           20             I'm going to provide a brief overview of 

           21    the legal issue on appeal, which is the application 

           22    of the functional test for business income.  Then 

           23    I'll briefly go over the law which requires 

           24    appellant show that it did not have operational ties 

           25    with China Construction Bank.  Then I will discuss 

           26    the evidence that shows appellant actually did have 

           27    operational ties with China Construction Bank.  

           28             The question before your Board is an issue 




                                                                    21




                                                                      


            1    of business/nonbusiness income, specifically whether 

            2    the income from the strategic investment by a bank 

            3    in another bank is apportioned between the several 

            4    states because the income is derived from its 

            5    banking business, which is what FTB has concluded 

            6    after analyzing the evidence provided by appellant, 

            7    or whether the income is allocated to the single 

            8    state of its corporate headquarters because it is a 

            9    mere investment as claimed by appellant.  

           10             In California all income is business income 

           11    unless clearly classifiable as nonbusiness income.  

           12    Income which arises from the conduct of a trade or 

           13    business is business income.  This includes the sale 

           14    of business assets.  Where the asset is an interest 

           15    in stock, the main criteria for determining whether 

           16    there is business income is whether the taxpayer and 

           17    the entity represented by the stock at issue had an 

           18    operational business relationship of some 

           19    significance.  

           20             Appellant's operational business 

           21    relationship of significance with China Construction 

           22    Bank included:  First, employee exchanges; second, a 

           23    Joint Venture Agreement for leasing activities; 

           24    third, reciprocal client referrals for banking 

           25    activities; fourth, reciprocal wire transfers that 

           26    benefited appellant's retail banking customers; and 

           27    fifth, reciprocal ATM fee waivers that benefited 

           28    appellants retail banking customers.  




                                                                    22




                                                                      


            1             I'm now going to go over the five points 

            2    identified indicating an operational business 

            3    relationship of significance between appellant and 

            4    China Construction Bank.  Any one of these ties in 

            5    and of itself would be enough for a finding of 

            6    business income.  

            7             First, the employee exchanges.  As 

            8    appellant's own documents make clear, 3100 of 

            9    appellant's employees went to China during the time 

           10    appellant held China Construction Bank stock and 

           11    engaged in dozens of technical projects in China in 

           12    order to strengthen the business activities of China 

           13    Construction Bank.  

           14             Second, the leasing venture.  Appellant 

           15    participated in a money lending business with China 

           16    Construction Bank.  Appellant's CEO attributed this 

           17    venture to its investment in China Construction 

           18    Bank.  Therefore, appellant's stake in China 

           19    Construction Bank generated business income through 

           20    operational ties and appellant's stake in China 

           21    Construction Bank served an operational business 

           22    function.  

           23             Third, reciprocal client referrals.  

           24    Appellant's reciprocal client referrals with China 

           25    Construction Bank were an operational tie of 

           26    significance.  Having clients is fundamental to a 

           27    business, and appellant's CEO said that appellant 

           28    was getting more clients because of its stake in 




                                                                    23




                                                                      


            1    China Construction Bank.  Therefore, appellant's 

            2    stake in China Construction Bank served an 

            3    operational business function.  

            4             Fourth, the reciprocal wire transfers.  

            5    Appellant had an agreement with China Construction 

            6    Bank that provided for reciprocal wire transfers and 

            7    allowed appellant's existing American retail banking 

            8    clients to send money to local ones in China.  This 

            9    project was actually piloted in California. 

           10    Reciprocal wire transfers provided better customer 

           11    service to appellant's clients and allowed appellant 

           12    to use its existing business assets better.  

           13             Appellant's CEO attributed the reciprocal 

           14    wire transfers to appellant's stake in China 

           15    Construction Bank.  Therefore, appellant's stake 

           16    allowed appellant to make better use of its existing 

           17    business assets.  This shows appellant's stake in 

           18    China Construction Bank had an operational business 

           19    function.  

           20             Fifth, reciprocal ATM fees -- ATM fee 

           21    waivers.  Appellant's ATM fee waiver program allowed 

           22    appellant's existing American retail banking clients 

           23    to withdraw money in China.  The ATM fee waiver 

           24    program was attributed to appellant's stake in China 

           25    Construction Bank by appellant's CEO, and therefore 

           26    appellant's stake allowed appellant to make better 

           27    use of its existing business assets.  This shows 

           28    appellant's stake in China Construction Bank had an 




                                                                    24




                                                                      


            1    operational business function.  

            2             Each of the ties between China Construction 

            3    Bank and appellant indicates an operational business 

            4    relationship of significance.  A benefit appellant 

            5    got out of this operational business relationship 

            6    was more banking business in China.  

            7             Appellant's cross-border loans into China 

            8    grew exponentially while appellant held a stake in 

            9    China Construction Bank.  In fact, appellant's local 

           10    Chinese banking business also dramatically grew 

           11    during the time it held a stake in China 

           12    Construction Bank.  Making loans is part of 

           13    appellant's trade or business, therefore those loans 

           14    generated business income in China.  

           15             The three connections between increased 

           16    loans in China and appellant's stake in China 

           17    Construction Bank are:  One, appellant's annual 

           18    report statements that its stake in China 

           19    Construction Bank would lead to better customer 

           20    service for its existing corporate clients; two, 

           21    appellant's CEO statement that it and China 

           22    Construction Bank had reciprocal client referrals; 

           23    and three, appellant's press release that had 

           24    increasing brand awareness in China through its 

           25    relationship with China Construction Bank.  

           26             Finally, your Board's decision in this 

           27    appeal impacts both future and existing taxpayers.  

           28    A decision in favor of appellant that deems the 




                                                                    25




                                                                      


            1    transaction before your Board nonbusiness income 

            2    would reduce the liabilities of taxpayers who have 

            3    corporate domicile outside of California since none 

            4    of the income or gains from transactions like the 

            5    one before your Board would be allocated to 

            6    California.  Thus, if appellant wins and such 

            7    transactions are deemed nonbusiness income, 

            8    similarly situated taxpayers with California 

            9    corporate domicile would have 100 percent of the 

           10    income from transactions like this one allocated to 

           11    California.  

           12             The Department asks that its claim denial 

           13    be sustained.  Mr. Swieso and I are here to answer 

           14    any of your questions.  Thank you.  

           15             MS. HARKEY:  You have rebuttal time.  

           16    Probably five minutes, I'd imagine.  

           17             MR. BRANNAN:  Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.  

           18             It's always interesting to do rebuttal.  I 

           19    mean, unfortunately, when there's not a lot to talk 

           20    about, we tend to place too much emphasis on the 

           21    things that we can talk about.  And I think there's 

           22    a lot of that going on in this case unfortunately.  

           23             You heard the witnesses present earlier.  

           24    And, again, I'm going to bring them up.  Of course 

           25    we may not have the full time to have them address 

           26    some of the statements.  But, you know, the bottom 

           27    line is a couple of the examples provided, you know, 

           28    we talked about the wire transfer and the leasing 




                                                                    26




                                                                      


            1    joint venture.  The information already provided 

            2    indicates that that was requested by CCB.  In 

            3    response to the question, yeah, it was related to 

            4    the investment.  That's fine.  But it was something 

            5    that we were asked to do and directed to do and in 

            6    both cases probably not something that we were all 

            7    that interested in doing.  

            8             We're also talking about, going back to the 

            9    test, this one-way flow of value.  I -- I -- I 

           10    disagree strongly with the characterization or 

           11    Strategic Assistance Agreement as an employee 

           12    exchange.  It's a training deal.  It's a training 

           13    operation.  And I am happy to bring Ms. Hood back up 

           14    here and explain in any amount of detail that 

           15    anybody's interested to say this is training only.  

           16             Further considerations, the ATMs, there's 

           17    suggestion after suggestion about expanding our 

           18    retail business, that just didn't happen.  The ATM 

           19    example is such that it is the same sort of 

           20    arrangement we had with people whether we had an 

           21    engagement with them or not, whether we had an 

           22    investment with them or not.  And so there's nothing 

           23    unusual about that.  

           24             With respect to the CEO comments, again, I 

           25    think Mr. Belk can speak to, you know, this 

           26    assertion of reciprocal client referrals.  Yes, 

           27    there is a statement to that effect; it was by one 

           28    of the CEOs.  However, when we tried to look into it 




                                                                    27




                                                                      


            1    and locate it, there's no formal arrangement, 

            2    there's no formal program, there's no process built 

            3    about that.  At best, it was probably a one-off 

            4    situation.  

            5             Continuing on, you know, really when we 

            6    talk about the statements that are attributable to 

            7    the CEO, when he talks about, you know, working 

            8    together with CCB and there is -- there are 

            9    statements in the records about a strategic 

           10    partnership -- really what we're talking about at 

           11    that point is they are, CCB and BAC did work 

           12    together.  Well, the way they worked together is we 

           13    provided them with advice so that we could invest in 

           14    the economy.  We helped them modernize their bank.  

           15    Everything that happened here is focused on doing 

           16    what we can to help CCB grow, to help CCB develop 

           17    into a modern bank in China.  The return for BAC was 

           18    on the economy.  The return was from its investment 

           19    and the ownership interest that it was able to trade 

           20    following the IPO.  

           21             I think Mr. Belk responded basically to the 

           22    comments about the wire transfers and also the ATM 

           23    usage.  

           24             I think the last point that I'd like to 

           25    make in rebuttal -- and, time permitting, may bring 

           26    up Mr. Belk and Ms. Hood to talk about some of the 

           27    comments -- but the expansion of the business as a 

           28    result of the investment, what -- what counsel has 




                                                                    28




                                                                      


            1    suggested is that because of one comment in the 

            2    press about employee referrals or -- excuse me -- 

            3    about corporate client referrals that we're unable 

            4    to really pin down or establish any program, that 

            5    the loan portfolio attributable to China grew in a 

            6    dramatic fashion.  

            7             The bottom line is that during this same 

            8    window of time the loan portfolio in India grew from 

            9    $560 million to 4.7 billion.  That growth was 

           10    attributable to the economy.  That growth was not 

           11    attributable to our investment in CCB.  Which, by 

           12    the way, the contract said we were unable to compete 

           13    with them; we could not grow our corporate client 

           14    base.  

           15             Also, if you look at China, the gross 

           16    domestic product for China during that same window, 

           17    it doubled.  We're talking about the economy.  When 

           18    the economy does that, numbers increase.  China at 

           19    this time was preparing to enter, just about to 

           20    enter with the World Trade Organization.  Now what 

           21    does that do to an economy?  If you're trying and 

           22    you've been closed for 20 years and all of a sudden 

           23    the World Trade Organization requires that you have 

           24    an open market, that's one of the requirements.  

           25    What happens to the investment in your country when 

           26    you're about to join the World Trade Organization?  

           27    Well, what happens is investment -- investment in 

           28    the economy increases.  It's kind of the rising tide 




                                                                    29




                                                                      


            1    floats all boats.  I mean that's really what's going 

            2    on with respect to those numbers.  

            3             Again, refer back to the contractual 

            4    provisions that limited the things that we could do 

            5    in the country.  Very deliberately it was set up so 

            6    that we wouldn't compete with CCB.  And that was the 

            7    goal.  We were supposed to help them grow, help them 

            8    modernize, and that's what we did.  That's what 

            9    everything was about.  

           10             If they wanted us to help them establish a 

           11    leasing joint venture, that's what we did.  If they 

           12    wanted us to help establish this wire transfer, 

           13    that's what we did.  We didn't have much choice in 

           14    that; that's what Mr. Smilie said.  Because of the 

           15    larger investment, if CCB said do this, that's what 

           16    we did.  

           17             And really, taking a half step back, this 

           18    is where we need to focus on the actual evidence, 

           19    not supposition, not trying to link together this 

           20    statement to this number, that there's no obvious 

           21    connection to.  What we need to do is to look at the 

           22    contracts.  

           23             We could not compete.  We could not make 

           24    any portion of the CCB business integral to our 

           25    business operations.  They were not interwoven, 

           26    inseparable to our operations.  We couldn't do it as 

           27    a matter of contract.  We couldn't do it because 

           28    their business and banking operations were 20 years 




                                                                    30




                                                                      


            1    old.  And we couldn't do it because the 70 percent 

            2    owner was the Chinese government.  

            3             That's the fundamental problem here.  The 

            4    Chinese government was not going to allow one of its 

            5    four state-owned national banks with a critical role 

            6    in the economy, they were not going to allow any 

            7    portion of that bank to become an integral portion 

            8    of Bank of America's business operations.  It simply 

            9    wasn't going to happen.  

           10             So that's the conclusion of my rebuttal.  I 

           11    would really encourage any questions from the Board 

           12    Members with respect to the three witnesses that we 

           13    have.  

           14             MS. HARKEY:  Thank you.  

           15             Okay, Members, do we have any questions?  

           16             Member Runner.  

           17             MR. RUNNER:  I guess the core issue that 

           18    I'm trying wade through here is that did -- maybe 

           19    you can tell me if this is what the core issue is, 

           20    at least from my perspective, and that is did B of A 

           21    increase its banking footprint in its activities in 

           22    China?  

           23             MR. BRANNAN:  I think that's a great 

           24    question, Mr. Runner.  The annual report suggests 

           25    there was an increase in the loan portfolio in 

           26    China.  We can't run from those numbers.  

           27             MR. RUNNER:  Mm-hmm.  

           28             MR. BRANNAN:  One of the questions is 




                                                                    31




                                                                      


            1    whether that was in any way related to our 

            2    investment in CCB.  

            3             With respect to the leasing joint venture, 

            4    you heard Mr. Smilie say no connection.  

            5             With respect to the data, we know gross 

            6    domestic product increased two-fold.  But I also 

            7    direct us back to the contractual provisions.  We 

            8    had to sell off -- 

            9             MR. RUNNER:  So what caused the increase 

           10    then?  

           11             MR. BRANNAN:  It's -- honestly, from our -- 

           12    I'll tell you what -- 

           13             Mr. Belk, would you mind?  

           14             MR. BELK:  Sure.  Thank you.  

           15             With respect to the increase in loans, as 

           16    reflected in our annual report, you know it really 

           17    was driven by the economic growth.  Mr. Brannan 

           18    referenced India, another country and Asia that had 

           19    similar growth at the same time.  So there was 

           20    double digit GDP growth within China during the 

           21    timeframe under question and, therefore, you would 

           22    expect the growth to, uh -- to happen during that 

           23    time.  

           24             We also were able to connect with one of 

           25    our corporate banking leaders who was in the 

           26    country, or in Asia during 2010 time frame and, you 

           27    know, he was adamant that the growth in the 

           28    portfolio was not linked to the CCB investment.  It 




                                                                    32




                                                                      


            1    was just linked to the growth in the economy and the 

            2    general growth in the region at the time.  

            3             MR. RUNNER:  So in your opinion those 

            4    things would have happened with or without the 

            5    contract with -- 

            6             MR. BELK:  Yes, sir.  I would say that the 

            7    increase or the growth there was driven by economic 

            8    activity, not funneled through our involvement with 

            9    CCB.  

           10             MR. RUNNER:  Okay.  Let me ask, back to -- 

           11    to FTB.  What -- what is it that you would believe 

           12    took place in this agreement that they -- I think 

           13    you used a good word -- funneled this growth to B of 

           14    A as a result of this relationship.  

           15             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Oh, um -- first, I got 

           16    the microphone, right?  

           17             MR. RUNNER:  Uh-huh.  

           18             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Okay.  

           19             The three connections that we have between 

           20    the increased banking business and appellant's 

           21    investment in China Construction Bank is appellant's 

           22    statements in its annual report and then appellant's 

           23    subsequent statements while they had that investment 

           24    from the CEO and the press release after all this 

           25    had gone on, talking about increased brand 

           26    awareness.  That's the evidence -- those are all 

           27    appellant's own documents and that's what we have to 

           28    go on.  That's why we -- that's the connections that 




                                                                    33




                                                                      


            1    we can show.  

            2             MR. BRANNAN:  Mr. Runner, perhaps -- 

            3             MR. RUNNER:  Let me just say my observation 

            4    is, you know -- sometimes -- I'm trying to struggle 

            5    with sometimes what is stated in a -- in a -- in a 

            6    document where a bank, or anybody else for that 

            7    matter, is talking about their business to their -- 

            8    to -- to their investors and -- and oftentimes 

            9    it's -- not that this would take place -- that 

           10    sometimes there's a bit of hyperbole in terms of why 

           11    it is and how good things go and what you attribute 

           12    it to as for it actually mechanically being 

           13    involved.  

           14             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  It sounds like you're 

           15    discussing puffery?  

           16             MR. RUNNER:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  

           17             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  The thing about puffery 

           18    is, puffery is, "This is the best car you're ever 

           19    going to drive and, you know, it growls like a 

           20    jaguar."  

           21             MR. RUNNER:  Uh-huh.  

           22             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  "It goes zero to 60 in 

           23    two seconds" is a statement of fact.  So these are 

           24    more towards the statement of fact.  

           25             "We have reciprocal client referrals" is a 

           26    statement of fact.  We are using this to increase 

           27    brand awareness.  "We are using this to increase 

           28    brand awareness" is more of a statement of fact.  




                                                                    34




                                                                      


            1             You can always say it's hyperbole.  But 

            2    when you start giving, like, we are doing specific 

            3    activities, it's no longer puffery.  

            4             MR. RUNNER:  Mm-hmm.  

            5             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  And these are statements 

            6    that are actionable if they are false.  

            7             MR. RUNNER:  Mm-hmm.  

            8             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  That's why these press 

            9    releases have disclaimers on the bottom of them.  So 

           10    if they make a representation of fact, you can rely 

           11    on them because it is actionable if they are false.  

           12             MR. RUNNER:  Okay.  Let me go back to the 

           13    taxpayers.  

           14             Why -- I mean what makes the difference 

           15    between the statements when the statements are so -- 

           16    seem to be so specific to the involvement that B of 

           17    A had with -- with CCB?  

           18             MR. BRANNAN:  The one question Mr. Belk 

           19    might focus on -- 

           20             Yes, sir.  

           21             MR. RUNNER:  Go ahead.  

           22             MR. BRANNAN:  No, I -- I'm going to -- one 

           23    of the comments that's been made is about corporate 

           24    referrals.  

           25             MR. RUNNER:  Uh-huh.  

           26             MR. BRANNAN:  And I was going to ask 

           27    Mr. Belk to specifically address that.  

           28             MR. RUNNER:  Well, I'd like a 




                                                                    35




                                                                      


            1    broader answer.  I'd like a broader answer as to why 

            2    it is that these would be -- would be seen as in 

            3    terms of documents -- in terms of institutional 

            4    documents that B of A had as to being so specific in 

            5    terms of describing the relationship.  

            6             MR. BELK:  Well, again, I think they -- you 

            7    know, we did have an investment in CCB and those 

            8    statements talked about that in broad terms.  So I 

            9    think we had mentioned earlier in terms of the 

           10    corporate referrals that were in fact mentioned in 

           11    the documents that were referenced.  

           12             MR. RUNNER:  So would you -- 

           13             MR. BELK:  Some of that would have likely 

           14    happened, but we haven't been able to determine, by 

           15    any means, any sort of material connection there.  

           16    There could have been a one-off referral here or 

           17    there between us to CCB or vice versa, but there was 

           18    no pervasive program that we've been able to 

           19    identify.  

           20             MR. RUNNER:  Should we be able to try to 

           21    identify or I guess try to separate out what would 

           22    be relationships because of the investment versus 

           23    integral -- a more integral part of the operational 

           24    side?  Is that -- is that a -- I mean just -- I mean 

           25    the issue, for instance, branding, did -- did -- 

           26    because B of A had an investment, did that increase 

           27    branding for B of A in China?  

           28             MR. BELK:  I would say not directly.  I 




                                                                    36




                                                                      


            1    mean there could have been some indirect influence 

            2    here and there.  But, again, it was not a pervasive 

            3    direct focused effort.  

            4             MR. RUNNER:  There was not an operational 

            5    relationship.  

            6             MR. BELK:  Right.  

            7             MR. BRANNAN:  Mr. Runner, you would think 

            8    with having the Bank of America, one of the, you 

            9    know, worldwide industry standards for banking as 

           10    the investor for CCB would help CCB.  So what I 

           11    think we're saying -- and again it's supposition is 

           12    that CCB wants -- 

           13             MR. RUNNER:  Again, my assumption is that 

           14    your argument is it would help -- it would help CCB 

           15    therefore -- therefore enhance your investment.  

           16             MR. BRANNAN:  Yes, sir.  

           17             MR. RUNNER:  But not because of your 

           18    operational involvement.  

           19             MR. BRANNAN:  Correct.  The banking 

           20    business that BAC had before and after the 

           21    investment was essentially the same.  There's no 

           22    change, there's no expansion, there's no meaningful 

           23    or material operational value that's equating or 

           24    accruing to BAC during the course of its 

           25    investment.  

           26             MR. RUNNER:  Let me speak specifically or 

           27    ask specifically about the -- again, I'm just, 

           28    because it was called out, the ATM reciprocal 




                                                                    37




                                                                      


            1    agreements or relationship.  You would say that that 

            2    was not tied to or because of the investment.  

            3             MR. BRANNAN:  I mean, David, I don't know 

            4    if you want to again --

            5             MR. BELK:  Well, look, it happened at the 

            6    same time, right?  

            7             MR. RUNNER:  Right.  

            8             MR. BELK:  So it's unclear whether you can 

            9    tie it directly or not.  

           10             I think our point is it was the identical 

           11    terms that we had with other ATM relationships, with 

           12    other multi-national banks across the world that we 

           13    did not have an investment with.  So it was the 

           14    exact same thing that we did with plenty of other 

           15    people, you know, at the same time.  Whether it was 

           16    directly linked, it's hard to say.  I mean it did 

           17    happen at the same time, so -- and obviously we're 

           18    talking with CCB.  

           19             MR. RUNNER:  But it may or may not have 

           20    happened because of the investment.  

           21             MR. BELK:  Correct.  

           22             MR. RUNNER:  Or wasn't required or wasn't 

           23    there because of the investment.  

           24             MR. BELK:  There was no -- to my knowledge 

           25    there was no requirement as part of the investment 

           26    to do the reciprocal ATM program.  

           27             MR. BRANNAN:  It's not in any of the 

           28    documents that we were able to review at any point 




                                                                    38




                                                                      


            1    in time.  It's -- the only one that's in the 

            2    contract, ironically, is the credit card memorandum.  

            3             MR. RUNNER:  As you've divested yourself of 

            4    the investment, what was the -- 

            5             See, I guess this is where I'm thinking 

            6    that if there was a big operational advantage that B 

            7    of A incurred or brought into their organization was 

            8    all of that, the divestment then would have a 

            9    negative effect then on the operational side.  

           10             Did you -- what was the experience at that 

           11    point?  

           12             MR. BELK:  Well, again, I -- 

           13             MR. RUNNER:  Did you lose customers?  Did 

           14    you lose -- I mean did -- 

           15             MR. BELK:  No, sir.  I mean it was 

           16    literally -- I mean, as I mentioned, we were selling 

           17    our noncore investments -- 

           18             MR. RUNNER:  Mm-hmm.  

           19             MR. BELK:  -- during the financial crisis.  

           20    We obviously picked almost all of our noncore 

           21    investments.  We picked those that, you know, we 

           22    didn't have a significant operational link with 

           23    because we could sell them.  In this case we could 

           24    have a nice profit to help our capital liquidity, 

           25    which was needed at the time and really not have any 

           26    operational impacts from that exit.  

           27             MR. RUNNER:  Okay, thank you.  

           28             I may come back.  




                                                                    39




                                                                      


            1             MS. HARKEY:  Thank you.  

            2             Any other Members?  

            3             Member Horton, I see you grabbing your mic.  

            4    Would you like to -- 

            5             MR. HORTON:  Uh, yes.  Thank you, Madam 

            6    Chair.  

            7             Question of the Department.  Is there any 

            8    contractual relationship that you've been able to 

            9    find that links the two together?  Links the various 

           10    reciprocal agreement, the ATM agreement, or is this 

           11    some inference because of a relationship that gave 

           12    them some advantage?  

           13             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Contractually, with the 

           14    agreements that we actually have contractually, only 

           15    the credit card joint venture was actually 

           16    contractually part of the agreement.  The inference 

           17    is based on appellant's own statements, subsequent 

           18    statements that the two were connected.  

           19             I mean the exhibit we circulated this 

           20    morning, there's some discussion by -- on Ms. Hood's 

           21    LinkedIn account about letters of intent regarding 

           22    business cooperation that she negotiated and her job 

           23    to facilitate business collaboration, interface 

           24    between the two companies.  But most of the 

           25    connections are there because appellant's CEOs said 

           26    that they were there.  And we felt we could rely on 

           27    that.  

           28             MR. HORTON:  Okay.  So is there anything, 




                                                                    40




                                                                      


            1    any governmental, legislative requirement on the 

            2    part of China, such as in the case of Mexico, that 

            3    would have linked these two together?  

            4             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Could -- not sure I 

            5    understand the question.  

            6             MR. HORTON:  In Mexico you actually 

            7    require -- the Mexican government actually requires 

            8    that there is -- in order to do business in Mexico, 

            9    you have to have these sort of relationships.  

           10             I'm trying to link this relationship to a 

           11    growth in their footprint.  

           12             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  We're not -- 

           13             MR. HORTON:  Aside from the conversations 

           14    and the LinkedIn.  

           15             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Yeah.  Well, I mean 

           16    there's China Construction Bank, and China 

           17    Construction Bank also has annual reports and they 

           18    consistently talk about more -- building more ties 

           19    with appellant.  

           20             So you have appellant -- appellant saying 

           21    they're going to seek all these additional strategic 

           22    ties.  The use of the phrase strategic investment is 

           23    used throughout, notwithstanding what's in the 

           24    contractual language; it's in the annual reports, 

           25    it's in Ms. Hood's LinkedIn profile.  I believe it's 

           26    in a few of the press releases as well.  

           27             So no, there doesn't -- as far as I know, 

           28    there's nothing statutory requiring these sorts of 




                                                                    41




                                                                      


            1    ties.  These sorts of ties were apparently agreed to 

            2    between the parties.  And based on appellant's 

            3    statements, it was linked directly to their state -- 

            4    appellant's investment in China Construction Bank.  

            5             MR. HORTON:  On the employee exchange, 

            6    share with me your thoughts on the mutual benefit, 

            7    and particularly the benefit to B of A.  

            8             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Well, let's see, 

            9    appellant -- appellant's press release said that 

           10    they got increasing experiences for the employees, 

           11    increasing brand awareness.  That's what -- that's 

           12    from appellant's own documents.  

           13             MR. HORTON:  From training their 

           14    employees.  

           15             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Mm-hmm.  Well, it was a 

           16    mutu -- I think -- yeah, it was a -- appellant was 

           17    training CCB's employees and appellant's own people 

           18    were going abroad to do that.  And they were getting 

           19    increasing connection -- they were getting 

           20    increasing exposure.  And appellant's own documents 

           21    indicate that appellant thought that that was good 

           22    for its own employees.  

           23             MR. HORTON:  Could this -- could this 

           24    training have taken place without the --

           25             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  That was explicitly 

           26    linked.  

           27             MR. HORTON:  Pardon?  

           28             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  The training -- the 




                                                                    42




                                                                      


            1    Strategic Assistant Agreement was explicitly linked 

            2    to the purchase.  So the employee exchanges in that 

            3    manner were explicitly linked to the purchase of 

            4    stock because all three of the contracts reference 

            5    each other.  

            6             MR. HORTON:  And so the link is the 

            7    training occurred, and as a result of that training 

            8    more people knew that the training was occurring so 

            9    therefore they did business with Bank of America.  

           10             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  That's what appellant's 

           11    press release would tend to indicate, yes.  

           12             MR. HORTON:  Wow.  

           13             The leasing venture -- well, how about the 

           14    growth in the -- GDP growth in the economy.  The 

           15    overall growth in the economy?  

           16             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Yes, that's undisputed 

           17    that China grew quite well during the period.  

           18             MR. HORTON:  You don't dispute that?  

           19             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  No.  

           20             MR. HORTON:  And why wouldn't that have 

           21    something to do with the growth of any business, 

           22    Bank of America, Chase, any other business in China?  

           23             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Well, in order to 

           24    actually start a leasing business -- leasing venture 

           25    in China, it was necessary for it to enter into that 

           26    joint venture agreement with China Construction 

           27    Bank.  China Construction Bank invited appellant 

           28    into a leasing joint venture.  And according to the 




                                                                    43




                                                                      


            1    statements we heard in appellant's case in chief, 

            2    they were China Construction Bank existing clients.  

            3             So appellant was getting a piece of the -- 

            4    a piece of these leases with China Construction 

            5    Bank's own clients that they were invited into by 

            6    China Construction Bank.  And China Construction 

            7    Bank most certainly did view appellant as a 

            8    strategic partner.  It's all over appellant's -- 

            9    it's all over China Construction Bank's annual 

           10    reports.  

           11             MR. HORTON:  What is the appellant's view 

           12    of that?  

           13             MR. BRANNAN:  Well, there's a number of 

           14    things with regard to growth in the loan and lease 

           15    portfolio.  

           16             The joint venture, the leasing joint 

           17    venture was not included in the numbers that we've 

           18    been talking about.  It's reflected as an equity 

           19    investment, so it's kept in a separate place on the 

           20    books.  There's no growth in the loan and lease 

           21    portfolio that's attributed to the leasing joint 

           22    venture.  So that would be point one.  

           23             The second point, strategic partnership.  

           24    And the words, they mean what they say and there's a 

           25    couple of points.  One is, it was a strategic 

           26    partnership.  We invest, we give you expertise, you 

           27    bring your bank into the modern age.  That's 

           28    strategic for both parties at that point.  




                                                                    44




                                                                      


            1             The second point, there's actual language 

            2    in most of the contracts that talk about this -- 

            3    these agreements do not form a partnership or joint 

            4    venture in a legal sense.  The contracts again 

            5    impose a bar or a fence between BAC and CCB which 

            6    prohibits any sort of kind of legal assertions of 

            7    this -- the relationship between the two.  And it's 

            8    to protect both of the parties, and it also signals 

            9    very strongly to anybody that wants to know, What 

           10    are you doing together?  

           11             So there's really two responses to that 

           12    question.  

           13             MR. HORTON:  To the -- to the, uh -- to the 

           14    position relative to the statements in the press and 

           15    so forth, we have witnesses here under oath 

           16    testifying that that's not the case.  How do you -- 

           17             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Did you swear them in?  

           18             MR. BRANNAN:  We're happy to do that if 

           19    that's required, Members of the Board.  

           20             MR. HORTON:  I'm presuming if they're here 

           21    they understand their obligation to tell the truth.  

           22             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  I would say that -- 

           23             MR. HORTON:  You want them to be sworn in, 

           24    is that a request, in order for their testimony to 

           25    have -- could be valid?  Is that the request of the 

           26    Department?  

           27             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Sure.  Yeah.  Please.  

           28             MR. HORTON:  Madam Chair.  




                                                                    45




                                                                      


            1             MS. HARKEY:  Okay, I'm going to need some 

            2    wording here.  What do we use to swear people in?  

            3    What is the appropriate manner?  

            4             MS. RICHMOND:  Who are we swearing in?  

            5             MS. HARKEY:  The three -- the three 

            6    witnesses.  

            7             If you would come up here and stand, 

            8    please.  

            9             MR. HORTON:  I don't believe it's 

           10    necessary, but I mean the Department has made -- 

           11             MS. HARKEY:  No, the Department wants it, 

           12    so let's just, let's just -- 

           13             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Okay, forgot about it.  

           14    Forget about it.  It's fine.  

           15             MS. HARKEY:  Are you okay?  You're okay 

           16    with it?  

           17             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Yeah.  I'm getting a lot 

           18    of shaking heads.  Let's not waste time.  

           19             MS. HARKEY:  Okay, thank you.  

           20             MR. HORTON:  Shaking heads from where?  

           21    We're not -- 

           22             MS. HARKEY:  Never mind.  We're good.  

           23    We're good.  

           24             MR. HORTON:  So let me make sure.  You're 

           25    waiving your right to have the witnesses sworn in.  

           26    You believe that's not necessary; is that -- is that 

           27    what you're saying?  

           28             MR. SWIESO:  We'll take them for their 




                                                                    46




                                                                      


            1    word.  

            2             MR. HORTON:  Yes or no?  

            3             MR. SWIESO:  Yes, we take them for their 

            4    word.  

            5             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  So what I would just go 

            6    and say is that we had written contemporaneous 

            7    documentation.  And although I'm taking them at 

            8    their word now, memories -- you know, memories fade 

            9    over time.  And it's after-the-fact, whereas what 

           10    we've been relying on was contemporaneous written 

           11    documentation.  

           12             MR. HORTON:  Okay.  Madam Chair, thank you 

           13    for that.  

           14             MS. HARKEY:  Thank you.  Anyone else want 

           15    to?  No?

           16             Okay.  

           17             MS. STOWERS:  Just some follow-up.  

           18             MS. HARKEY:  Ms. Stowers.  

           19             MS. STOWERS:  To the Department, so you're 

           20    saying you have written contemporaneous 

           21    documentation; and it looks like it's mainly from 

           22    their CEO, and the annual reports and the press 

           23    statements.  

           24             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  We have their press 

           25    statements, their annual reports, and their CEO 

           26    statements.  

           27             With regard to the leasing venture, those 

           28    are corroborated by China Construction Bank report, 




                                                                    47




                                                                      


            1    annual reports.  That's -- that's the evidence that 

            2    we've put forward.  

            3             MS. STOWERS:  So is it your opinion that 

            4    these written documents should give more weight -- 

            5             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Absolutely.  

            6             MS. STOWERS:  -- than the oral arguments?  

            7             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Because not only are they 

            8    written, they are contemporaneous.  And again, as 

            9    appellant mentioned in its case in chief, those 

           10    press releases had to be counter-signed by China 

           11    Construction Bank.  

           12             MR. HORTON:  Yeah, but the challenge is is 

           13    that, if I'm not mistaken, are those statements 

           14    subsequent to the actual agreement?  

           15             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  The press release 

           16    statements are subsequent to the actual agreement, 

           17    yes.  

           18             MR. HORTON:  So it's not part of the 

           19    agreement.  No one really said -- 

           20             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  No, they are not part of 

           21    the contract.  

           22             MR. HORTON:  -- said before that we're 

           23    going to enter into this agreement for this 

           24    purpose.  

           25             MS. STOWERS:  Except for -- 

           26             MR. HORTON:  I don't know.  I'm asking.  

           27    Did that exist somewhere?  Is there evidence that it 

           28    was a condition of the agreement or that it was 




                                                                    48




                                                                      


            1    prior to the agreement, these statements?  

            2             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  No.  

            3             MR. HORTON:  Then the statement becomes an 

            4    opinion as to what may have happened as a result of 

            5    not only that activity but any other activity that 

            6    may have taken place subsequent to the contract.  

            7             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Well, if you're relying 

            8    on the annual reports, that would be absolutely the 

            9    case.  It would be purely aspirational.  

           10             MR. HORTON:  Right.  

           11             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  But what you have are the 

           12    annual reports which are aspirational, followed by 

           13    the actual statements about what was actually going 

           14    on subsequent.  

           15             MR. HORTON:  And so -- 

           16             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  And so then you have an 

           17    operational tie between the two businesses of 

           18    significance, which is what is required under the 

           19    law.  

           20             MR. HORTON:  The ATM agreement -- question 

           21    of the appellant -- the ATM agreement, is it unique, 

           22    different from any other ATM agreement?  

           23             MR. BRANNAN:  No.  It's not -- let me -- 

           24    let me be very precise in the answer, Mr. Horton.  

           25    Not all ATM arrangements are the same.  

           26             MR. HORTON:  Right.  

           27             MR. BRANNAN:  The reciprocal use with CCB 

           28    for free was identical in every way to the 




                                                                    49




                                                                      


            1    arrangement that BAC had with what we're labeling 

            2    the global ATM alliance, which was a group of 10 or 

            3    12 European banks.  And that, from what we've been 

            4    able to understand, was the model for the 

            5    arrangement with CCB.  

            6             MR. HORTON:  Was that -- was that 

            7    anticipated in any way that you had entered into 

            8    these agreements?  

            9             MR. BRANNAN:  No.  We -- we poked around, 

           10    and I can ask Mr. Belk to come back up.  But we 

           11    tried to figure out where that came from and we 

           12    don't know.  

           13             MR. HORTON:  To what extent subsequently 

           14    was it beneficial to B of A to enter into that 

           15    agreement?  

           16             MR. BRANNAN:  I think that, you know, as 

           17    Mr. Belk indicated, there's an economic cost to the 

           18    bank because they're missing their transaction fee.  

           19    There is some value to the individual customers that 

           20    don't have to pay that fee.  It does -- I mean I can 

           21    make the FTB's argument, I could expand their 

           22    network of ATMs around the country and that could be 

           23    conceived as value.  

           24             MR. HORTON:  Did it increase access for 

           25    your customers?  

           26             MR. BRANNAN:  It would because it -- well, 

           27    not necessarily.  It increased free access.  

           28             MR. HORTON:  Free access.  They still had 




                                                                    50




                                                                      


            1    the access.  

            2             MR. BRANNAN:  Yes, sir.  

            3             MS. HARKEY:  I have some questions while 

            4    we're thinking here.  

            5             What was -- just real simply.  Why did B of 

            6    A do this?  

            7             MR. BRANNAN:  To invest in the economy.  So 

            8    when they acquired their equity interest -- going 

            9    back in 2005, before they went public, a 

           10    knowledgeable investor had the opportunity to take 

           11    out an equity interest.  And when they go public we 

           12    know what happens to the value.  But because of 

           13    their knowledge, they were able to invest.  

           14             And so the reason they invested is as soon 

           15    as it went public, they had a pretty good idea that 

           16    the value was going to go up.  Further, their 

           17    training was in an effort to modernize the bank.  

           18    The more modern they became, the more people in the 

           19    economy that would use CCB, the greater CCB's 

           20    business -- 

           21             MS. HARKEY:  I understand what CCB got out 

           22    of it.  But what did BAC get out of it?  

           23             MR. BRANNAN:  Ultimately we were able to 

           24    get dividends, that's what's really at issue in 

           25    2008, from our equity investment.  And over time we 

           26    were able to acquire more.  Our investment went from 

           27    10 to 19 percent, 19.9 for one period of time and 

           28    back down to 10.  But when we were able to sell 




                                                                    51




                                                                      


            1    those shares there was significant gains from those 

            2    sales on the open market.  And then ultimately when 

            3    we sold out, it helped -- you know, it helped 

            4    increase kind of our capital requirements.  And you 

            5    remember that window what was going on with the 

            6    banks.  

            7             MS. HARKEY:  Oh, I remember.  Everybody was 

            8    cratering.  

            9             MR. BRANNAN:  Right.  

           10             MS. HARKEY:  What, um -- what percentage of 

           11    your total bank was the investment in CCB?  It says 

           12    it was 3 billion to purchase 9 percent.  

           13             MR. BRANNAN:  Three billion was the 

           14    purchase.  I'm not sure from a property standpoint.  

           15             Is that the kind of thing you might know?  

           16             MS. HARKEY:  It's a trick question.  Think 

           17    about -- no, I'm just wondering because it -- I'm 

           18    sure it's not, you know, 50 percent of the bank or 

           19    40 percent or 30 percent.  

           20             MR. BELK:  From our balance sheet 

           21    (inaudible).  

           22             MS. HARKEY:  That's what I thought.  So 

           23    that's my point.  It was a small investment.  And it 

           24    seems like it was -- it seems like it was more of an 

           25    investment to me in the fact that -- in the fact 

           26    that you've got, you know, returns on it.  You've 

           27    got, you know, your dividends, etcetera.  

           28             MR. BRANNAN:  Your dividends and the gain 




                                                                    52




                                                                      


            1    and the sale.  

            2             MS. HARKEY:  So to the FTB, how does this 

            3    differ from making an investment anywhere else?  

            4             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Because of the 

            5    operational ties between appellant and China 

            6    Construction Bank, that's what makes the 

            7    difference.  

            8             MS. HARKEY:  Okay.  And you're saying that 

            9    the operational ties.  Okay.  They had -- they only 

           10    had one person nominated from BAC of CCB's 19-person 

           11    board, correct?  

           12             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  That's true.  

           13             MS. HARKEY:  Okay.  And so I'm trying to -- 

           14    trying to figure out the big investment here and I'm 

           15    not -- what about -- I think the numerous statements 

           16    and whatnot may have shown B of A's intent.  But do 

           17    they actually prove integration?  

           18             MR. SPERRING:  And, Madam Chair -- 

           19             MS. HARKEY:  Yes, go ahead, Mr. Sperring.  

           20             MR. SPERRING:  May I talk about that 

           21    because that's something that's been giving me great 

           22    consternation here, right?  We're hearing -- 

           23             MS. RICHMOND:  Please state your name for 

           24    the record.  

           25             MR. SPERRING:  Sure.  This is Jon Sperring, 

           26    PricewaterhouseCoopers.  

           27             And you hear FTB talk about operational 

           28    tie, right, and they say if there's operational tie 




                                                                    53




                                                                      


            1    that's enough.  And the exact quote is, I'm going to 

            2    list five operational ties of some significance.  

            3             And by the way, one of those five is the 

            4    wire transfer where you heard that we had 1600 

            5    customers, okay, make wire transfers, right, so 

            6    that's one of their five significant operational 

            7    ties, okay.  

            8             But if you look at what the law says, 

            9    right, if you look at Hoechst Celanese, the 

           10    California Supreme Court, which basically follows 

           11    Board of Equalization opinions on it, okay, it -- 

           12    here's what the court said, it said, related to the 

           13    functional test: 

           14              Not surprisingly, the parties disagree 

           15    over the meaning of "integral."  Hoechst contends 

           16    "integral" means necessary or essential.  FTB 

           17    counters "integral" only means contributing to or in 

           18    other words an operational tie.  

           19             We, however, find both interpretations 

           20    inaccurate.  And what do they say?  They quote Holly 

           21    Sugar, Board of Equalization opinion, okay, for what 

           22    is an operational tie or what is integral, excuse 

           23    me.  And what they say is the activities of the two 

           24    companies constitute one indivisible composite 

           25    whole, each portion giving value to the other 

           26    portion, okay.  

           27             So it's one company, Bank of America and 

           28    the China Construction Bank are an indivisible 




                                                                    54




                                                                      


            1    whole, okay.  And if you look at they're citing two 

            2    cases, okay -- they cite many Board of Equalization 

            3    cases, but two that I think are very helpful, okay, 

            4    because they're both California companies.  They're 

            5    both cases -- it's Standard Oil and Occidental 

            6    Petroleum, okay, LA and San Francisco, right.  

            7             And in both those cases FTB wanted it to be 

            8    nonbusiness income.  And in the case of Standard 

            9    Oil, okay, the investment, the joint venture that 

           10    Standard had, okay, that FTB characterized as 

           11    nonbusiness income was Saudi Aramco, okay.  At this 

           12    time Chevron owned Saudi Aramco, right.  And that 

           13    entity produced 52 percent of Chevron's worldwide 

           14    oil supply.  

           15             And in fact, okay, although Chevron owned 

           16    30 percent -- excuse me, Standard owned 30 percent 

           17    of Saudi Aramco, okay, if they didn't buy 30 percent 

           18    of the oil produced, they only got seven-and-a-half 

           19    percent of the profit.  So the only way they could 

           20    get their full 30 percent share was they had to 

           21    purchase their full oil allotment.  And in fact, 

           22    Saudi Aramco was precluded from selling to anyone 

           23    else, okay.  Hence, you're seeing the integrated.  

           24    That's the integration that the court talked 

           25    about -- that your Board, excuse me, okay, that your 

           26    Board adopted and that the California Supreme Court 

           27    favorably cited.  

           28             Now let's go to Occidental Petroleum, 




                                                                    55




                                                                      


            1    right, and the great Dr. Armand Hammer who bought 

            2    that company that was started in 1920.  Occidental 

            3    Petroleum, before Dr. Hammer bought it in 1957 was a 

            4    hundred percent California Oil Company, right.  So 

            5    it explored oil in the LA area, right, and refined 

            6    it.  It was a hundred percent California.  And 

            7    Dr. Hammer turned it into this international 

            8    goliath, okay, with holdings in Libya, okay, and it 

            9    was in all different types of investments.  It was 

           10    becoming an energy company.  They had coal, okay.  

           11    They had different investments, okay.  

           12             And one of the five investments that FTB, 

           13    okay, tried to assert as business income was an oil 

           14    patch in Kern County.  So of course everyone would 

           15    think Occidental Petroleum, right, is buying an oil 

           16    patch in Kern County, okay, that's going to be 

           17    business income.  

           18             But your Board, okay, rightly said, 

           19    according to California Supreme Court, that is not 

           20    business income because it was -- they weren't able 

           21    to integrate it in.  And why?  Because although they 

           22    bought a minority interest in this Kern County land 

           23    company, Tenneco came in, they basically sold out to 

           24    Tenneco and Tenneco became the majority owner and 

           25    blocked Oxy from getting control of it, okay.  And 

           26    therefore Oxy sold it as a gain.  

           27             So their whole purpose of buying Kern 

           28    County land was to get the oil to integrate into 




                                                                    56




                                                                      


            1    their worldwide oil operation and -- and -- but they 

            2    were blocked because the management of Kern County 

            3    land sold out to Tenneco.  

            4             Okay.  And so that's the type of 

            5    integration we're talking about, not some 

            6    operational tie.  

            7             And I go lastly to ASARCO, U.S. Supreme 

            8    Court case on the very same UDIPTA statute that 

            9    California's adopted in 25128.  And in ASARCO, okay, 

           10    in southern Peru, okay, what you had was the U.S. 

           11    Supreme Court saying the closest question posed by 

           12    ASARCO's receipts of dividend are from southern 

           13    Peru.  ASARCO is one of southern Peru's four 

           14    shareholders, owning 51 percent of the stock.  

           15             Southern Peru produces smelted, unrefined 

           16    blistered copper and 35 percent of their output is 

           17    sold to ASARCO, okay.  But the court says it's 

           18    nonbusiness, okay, and that's because ASARCO's 

           19    majority interest, if asserted, could enable it to 

           20    control management over southern Peru but the 

           21    remaining shareholders would bail if they did that.  

           22    And as a result ASARCO didn't assert total control 

           23    over southern Peru, okay.  

           24             So now that's the standard.  And we 

           25    basically have the Franchise Tax Board saying that 

           26    this arm of the People's Republic of China is 

           27    integral to the Bank of America.  That's where we 

           28    are today.  




                                                                    57




                                                                      


            1             MS. HARKEY:  Thank you.  You really 

            2    expend -- I mean there -- there might be intent, but 

            3    that doesn't necessarily prove integration.  

            4             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  May I respond?  

            5             MS. HARKEY:  You may.  Yes, please.  

            6             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  There were subsequent 

            7    cases to the ones he just mentioned.  There was 

            8    Allied Signal, which came after ASARCO, which said 

            9    that the test is whether there is an operational 

           10    rather than an investment function.  That was a 

           11    subsequent U.S. Supreme Court case.  

           12             Following that U.S. Supreme Court case, 

           13    your Board in its last word on minority business -- 

           14    on minority stock business income/nonbusiness income 

           15    cases -- this is not the first time this kind of 

           16    case has happened -- but the last published word 

           17    your Board has on this was CTS Keene, which came 

           18    after Occidental and Standard Oil, and it repeated 

           19    the Allied Signal test and it said that the test is 

           20    operational versus investment function.  It also 

           21    explicitly rejected the contention that you need 

           22    control over the invest -- the company that the 

           23    taxpayer invests in.  

           24             MR. SPERRING:  I'm happy to respond to that 

           25    if you'd like.  

           26             MS. HARKEY:  All right.  Our two attorneys, 

           27    go ahead.  

           28             MR. SPERRING:  Thank you.  I mean, the 




                                                                    58




                                                                      


            1    quote that I think of Allied Signal that's most 

            2    helpful here is the mere fact that an intangible 

            3    asset was required pursuant to a long-term corporate 

            4    strategy of acquisitions and dispositions does not 

            5    convert an otherwise passive investment into an 

            6    integral one or an operational one.  And that's what 

            7    this was.  It was a passive investment.  

            8             The only reason why the People's Republic 

            9    of China allowed Bank of America to buy in -- 

           10    because they could have allowed anyone.  They 

           11    could've allowed a Saudi oil sheik to buy in, but 

           12    they allowed Bank of America because they wanted 

           13    Bank of America, a sophisticated investor.  They 

           14    wanted the knowledge from Bank of America.  That was 

           15    part of the cash, essentially, the bank offered.  

           16             It would have brought to the table, besides 

           17    this 3 billion bucks was this strategic system 

           18    agreement, this unique knowledge of western banking.  

           19    That's what they got.  That was part of the 

           20    investment, okay.  

           21             But other than that, this is a passive 

           22    investment for the bank that they were able to get 

           23    given the fact that they have, they're a world 

           24    leader, as we heard Mr. Belk say they're a world 

           25    leader in banking, in the banking business in the 

           26    west and China wanted them in there to teach their 

           27    bank.  And so this is what they had to bring to the 

           28    table, along with the cash.  




                                                                    59




                                                                      


            1             So we're perfectly -- you're perfectly 

            2    consistent with Allied Signal when you find that 

            3    this is nonbusiness income because this is a passive 

            4    investment.  

            5             MS. HARKEY:  I do believe it's more of an 

            6    investment because of the dollars.  It was not huge.  

            7    The dollars were not huge, the control was not 

            8    there.  

            9             If B of A would have pulled out, oh, a year 

           10    earlier, would that have mattered to CCB?  I mean 

           11    would -- would -- would B of A have suffered for 

           12    that?  

           13             MR. BRANNAN:  I -- I -- I always want to 

           14    answer the question.  We had lock-up provisions that 

           15    governed when we could sell our investment interest.  

           16             MS. HARKEY:  Right.  

           17             MR. BRANNAN:  As a general rule we sold 

           18    very shortly after the expiration of those.  It's a 

           19    three-year lock-up.  We sold very shortly after that 

           20    three-year provision.  

           21             The window where we got rid of where we 

           22    sold, you know, very large portion of it we were in 

           23    financial straits.  And as indicated by Mr. Belk and 

           24    also in the press releases, which I'm kind of loathe 

           25    to refer to because I want to look at the contracts, 

           26    but the press releases were pretty clear, we're 

           27    selling noncore assets because we need capital.  

           28             MS. HARKEY:  Yeah.  I think just there's so 




                                                                    60




                                                                      


            1    many things that indicate it was an investment, and 

            2    actually not a really large one.  It was an 

            3    investment for which you got a return.  And then 

            4    when things cratered here, you sold it out, which -- 

            5             MR. SPERRING:  And, Madam Chair -- 

            6             MS. HARKEY:  Yes.  

            7             MR. SPERRING:  Can I address CTS Keene if 

            8    you wouldn't mind?  

            9             MS. HARKEY:  If you wouldn't mind, yes.  

           10             MR. SPERRING:  Thank you.  Thank you.  

           11             MS. HARKEY:  Just be quick.  

           12             MR. SPERRING:  So CTS Keene, right, CTS 

           13    Keene, an American company, okay, gave AB, okay 

           14    which was a British company, their entire license 

           15    agreement to market in Europe, okay.  So, and they 

           16    originally had a German subsidiary that was selling 

           17    their products, okay, and they ended up closing it 

           18    down, okay, and in return AB allowed them to buy 

           19    minority interests, okay, and they issued a 

           20    licensing agreement, two separate licensing 

           21    agreements, to let them market all of their products 

           22    in Europe.  Hence, it was vital; AB was vital for 

           23    their European operations.  

           24             They shut down their previous wholly owned 

           25    subsidiary, turned it over to AB.  And once they got 

           26    the licensing agreement in place, then they sold.  

           27    And in fact what your Board said, CTS' real goal was 

           28    not to achieve a return on the stock, but rather was 




                                                                    61




                                                                      


            1    to support AB's efforts under the licensing 

            2    agreements to help create a broader worldwide market 

            3    for various products developed by CTS Unitary Group.  

            4             There is no evidence of that here in the 

            5    record.  There's no evidence that we were using an 

            6    arm of the People's Republic of China, okay to 

            7    service our global clients.  That's not what was 

            8    going on here.  

            9             MS. HARKEY:  No, that's not what appears to 

           10    be going on here, especially the fact that you 

           11    bailed and that was the end of it.  

           12             But I do see that you probably got some 

           13    benefit in the loan portfolio just by familiarizing 

           14    yourself with China, by having a name out there, 

           15    that was beneficial.  But that doesn't mean that you 

           16    were integrated.  And it doesn't mean that B of A, 

           17    that that was part of your normal course of 

           18    business.  

           19             Thank you.  

           20             Anyone else?  

           21             MS. STOWERS:  Madam Chair?  

           22             MS. HARKEY:  Yes.  Member Stowers.  

           23             MS. STOWERS:  To the appellants -- I don't 

           24    want to put words in your mouth -- but did you say 

           25    it was a passive investment, or just an investment 

           26    in general?  

           27             MR. SPERRING:  I was quoting the Board, 

           28    which found that those investments were passive.  




                                                                    62




                                                                      


            1             MS. STOWERS:  Okay.  So what would you say 

            2    about Bank of America's investment into China 

            3    Commercial Bank or CCB?  

            4             MR. SPERRING:  I would say that we -- we 

            5    were a knowledgeable investor, okay, that we didn't 

            6    have -- if we hadn't had that ability to do the 

            7    Strategic Consulting Agreement, right, Assistance 

            8    Agreement, they probably would not have taken us.  

            9    They wanted us to share knowledge with them.  But it 

           10    was never to help get them up to the ways of the 

           11    western banking system.  But it was never to be 

           12    integrated.  

           13             MR. BRANNAN:  I -- I -- if I may.  

           14             MS. STOWERS:  Yes, please.  

           15             MR. BRANNAN:  I think the distinction -- I 

           16    mean any sort of investment certainly falls on a 

           17    continuum.  And I think the language quoted of the 

           18    idea of a passive investment is on one end where the 

           19    money goes in and we do nothing.  But I think in the 

           20    case, the comparison between a passive investment 

           21    and the other type is when the investor, in this 

           22    case say BAC, is actively involved in the management 

           23    by inserting some of its people in the C-Suite, for 

           24    example, or they have a majority or a vocal piece of 

           25    the board of directors.  That would be, again, my -- 

           26    my understanding of the case authorities, that's an 

           27    active investor.  

           28             And then you have a situation like this 




                                                                    63




                                                                      


            1    where we really need to resort to the language of 

            2    Hoechst Celanese, the two-way flow of value, where 

            3    if we're in there and we're just training and 

            4    there's no true opportunity for us to learn or to 

            5    enhance our operations, then it clearly falls more 

            6    on the passive investment type situation, or at 

            7    least on that side of the fence when you're talking 

            8    about the biz/nonbusiness determination.  

            9             MS. STOWERS:  I follow what you're saying.  

           10    The issue that I am having is that you do -- you did 

           11    have those agreements, the SSA; which, to me, is 

           12    different than any other investment and it was a 

           13    condition of B of A.  In order to acquire the stock, 

           14    they had to enter into those agreements.  So they 

           15    definitely went hand-in-hand.  

           16             So, to me, it's different than your typical 

           17    investment.  And I realize that what BOA invested 

           18    was small compared to their overall assets.  

           19             MR. BRANNAN:  Yes.  

           20             MS. STOWERS:  But I don't think that's 

           21    really important to determine whether or not we have 

           22    business or nonbusiness income.  

           23             MR. BRANNAN:  There is -- there is a 

           24    materiality requirement in the Hoechst Celanese 

           25    case, but I don't want to ignore the point that 

           26    you're trying to make.  

           27             MS. STOWERS:  -- I'm trying to make.  No, 

           28    no.  I'm following it.  




                                                                    64




                                                                      


            1             MR. BRANNAN:  Okay.  

            2             MS. STOWERS:  Definitely there has to be 

            3    integration and there has to be value both ways.  

            4             MR. BRANNAN:  Mm-hmm.  

            5             MS. STOWERS:  I'm going to ask the 

            6    Department, you guys are relying a great deal on 

            7    annual reports and press statements where they 

            8    basically said we entered into -- I don't have it up 

            9    right now -- we did the ATM arrangement or we did 

           10    the lease arrangement or we did -- they defaulted on 

           11    the credit card.  But several, at least four 

           12    arrangements they did, and when they made those 

           13    press announcements they referenced their investment 

           14    with the Chinese bank.  

           15             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Yes.  

           16             MS. STOWERS:  And I'm kind of paraphrasing.  

           17    So can you help me out?  So is it your argument that 

           18    this -- 

           19             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Because these -- 

           20             MS. STOWERS:  -- does show the operational 

           21    integration and the value back and forth and that 

           22    BOA, Bank of America, would not have had the 

           23    opportunity to make these arrangements had they 

           24    not -- 

           25             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  What we -- what we have 

           26    are these operational ties and we're relying on 

           27    appellant's own statements to -- to attribute those 

           28    to appellant's investment in China Construction 




                                                                    65




                                                                      


            1    Bank.  We can establish that those operational ties 

            2    exist and we can establish that the appellants had 

            3    an investment in China Construction Bank, and 

            4    fitting the two together ultimately comes down to us 

            5    believing appellant's contemporaneous statements.  

            6             Is that the -- I'm sorry if I -- 

            7             MS. STOWERS:  I'm just trying to work this 

            8    out through my -- through my head.  

            9             To Mr. Sperring, I think you wanted to add 

           10    onto something.  

           11             MR. SPERRING:  Thank you, yeah, Madam 

           12    Stowers.  You bring up a great point.  And I guess I 

           13    would steer you to the Appeal of Mark Controls, 

           14    right.  So in Mark Controls the, uh -- the American 

           15    company had directors, right, in Weir and they were 

           16    not happy with the way Weir was managing their 

           17    operations, right.  So you have two valve companies 

           18    and they want to use Weir, which is based in 

           19    Scotland, to sell their products in Europe.  

           20             And so they have their directors, right, 

           21    become executives in the company to help steer the 

           22    management of the company.  

           23             Okay, so that occurs.  Those directors were 

           24    unsuccessful in turning the company around to the 

           25    way that Weir thought it would be managed.  

           26    Therefore -- or, excuse me, the way CTS wanted Weir 

           27    managed.  Therefore, CTS sold out, they gave up, got 

           28    a -- and had a gain.  Your Board held nonbusiness 




                                                                    66




                                                                      


            1    income even though those corporate officers were 

            2    there and were active in the company.  

            3             MS. STOWERS:  I understand.  And I 

            4    understand Mark Control and that would kind of track 

            5    for me, especially when you look at the desired 

            6    credit card arrangement that did not take place.  

            7             But we still have the leasing arrangement.  

            8    We still have the ATMs, we still have the wire free.  

            9    So there are some other programs that they entered 

           10    into with them that did come to life.  

           11             MR. SPERRING:  Right.  

           12             MS. STOWERS:  So I'm not really convinced 

           13    that Mark Control is controlling.  

           14             MR. SPERRING:  I -- I hear you.  I hear 

           15    you.  On those three points, I think, are valid.  

           16    And then I would go to Hoechst where they said some 

           17    connection is not enough.  

           18             MS. STOWERS:  Okay.  To the Department, did 

           19    you want to respond to that?  

           20             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Well, with Mark Controls 

           21    that's exactly our position.  Yes, that would be 

           22    very pertinent to the credit card venture and not to 

           23    anything else.  

           24             With respect to Celanese, we would just 

           25    point out that what they did -- what they say is 

           26    there has to be material production of business 

           27    income and has to materially contribute to the 

           28    production of business income.  




                                                                    67




                                                                      


            1             We know that there was business income from 

            2    the leasing venture.  We know that exploiting the 

            3    Chinese market was certainly material to their 

            4    business.  This -- this was a plan to get money from 

            5    more banking in China, and it succeeded.  The 

            6    leasing venture was a part of that.  

            7             We have shown that there is an oper -- that 

            8    there are operational ties.  We have appellant's 

            9    officers saying -- connecting that to the 

           10    investment, and that's all that's required.  

           11             MS. STOWERS:  Do you think there's some 

           12    type of disconnect that they treated the leasing 

           13    income as business income, but yet the overall 

           14    investment is, they're saying is nonbusiness?  

           15             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Well, on the original 

           16    return everything was business income.  And so, you 

           17    know, on the claim we don't -- I mean we think 

           18    it's -- we think it was always -- we think they were 

           19    right on the original return, so we don't really see 

           20    a disconnect.  

           21             I think what they're trying -- if what 

           22    you're getting at is, you know, how can you have the 

           23    leasing venture be nonbusiness or business and have 

           24    the gains from the stock be something different, 

           25    yes, we think that because the leasing venture is 

           26    clearly business income; they are talking about how 

           27    it wasn't a very good business for them and they 

           28    wanted to get out.  And leasing is clearly part of 




                                                                    68




                                                                      


            1    the bank's core business, that makes that business 

            2    income.  Since the stock is part -- since the stock 

            3    was responsible for the leasing venture, we think 

            4    that that brings in the stock as well.  

            5             I don't think they've ever actually claimed 

            6    that the stock -- that the leasing venture was ever 

            7    nonbusiness income.  They've cert -- or I don't -- I 

            8    don't believe they've presented that argument.  

            9             MS. STOWERS:  Go ahead.  

           10             MR. BRANNAN:  No, I think there's a few 

           11    points to make.  And I appreciate your question 

           12    because certainly that was something raised in the 

           13    hearing summary.  

           14             One, the statute requires us to evaluate 

           15    income based on its -- I'm going to be very 

           16    nontechnical -- source.  Where did the money come 

           17    from?  It came from the property.  So we have to 

           18    evaluate the income from the leasing joint venture 

           19    differently or separately -- who knows what the 

           20    answer's going to be when you start down that 

           21    path -- from the income that came to us either as 

           22    dividend or gains on sale from the CCB investment.  

           23             So we look at those separately.  That's 

           24    what the law requires.  And so there's really two 

           25    things then that are set up.  Did we properly 

           26    evaluate the nature of the income from the leasing 

           27    joint venture?  And I'll tell you, Ms. Mirandi here 

           28    is going to walk through why we got to that 




                                                                    69




                                                                      


            1    conclusion.  But we're doing the best we can and if 

            2    we follow the law and we evaluate them separately, 

            3    which is what we're required, I mean that's -- 

            4    that's what happens here.  

            5             And then the second question, which I'll 

            6    get to after Karen speaks, is really, Does it have 

            7    any bearing at all on how we treat CCB?  So there's 

            8    two layers of questions here.  

            9             So why did we file the way we did with 

           10    regard to the leasing joint venture?  

           11             MS. MIRANDI:  Sure, Derick, I'm happy to 

           12    address that.  

           13             So under the terms of the leasing JV 

           14    agreement there were several provisions that were 

           15    different than what was under the investment 

           16    agreement for the CCB stock.  So first of all, and I 

           17    think Mr. Smilie may have mentioned this before, we 

           18    had three employees that were seconded from BAC to 

           19    the leasing joint venture; there was a Chief 

           20    Operating Officer, a Chief Risk Officer and then a 

           21    more junior level marketing executive that was 

           22    involved.  

           23             Second, through the terms of the Chief 

           24    Operating Officer's responsibilities we, BAC, had 

           25    the right to request that CCB actually guarantee 

           26    some of the specific lease transactions.  So we had 

           27    some level of control there.  

           28             Third -- and this one is, to me, of 




                                                                    70




                                                                      


            1    particular importance -- BAC held a super majority 

            2    vote over some of the more substantial provisions 

            3    within the leasing JV, which included deciding the 

            4    business plan, deciding the investment plan, and 

            5    also being part of the preparation of the annual 

            6    financial budget for the leasing JV.  

            7             And then, again, BAC was entitled to a pro 

            8    rata share of the income from that joint venture 

            9    based on their ownership percentage.  

           10             So these provisions taken together appear 

           11    to -- to -- to suggest a level of control and 

           12    decision making in the leasing JV that was not 

           13    inherent in the investment in the CCB stock.  And so 

           14    when we looked at that and we were looking at filing 

           15    our refund claim, we took that into consideration.  

           16    And, quite honestly, the amount of income that was 

           17    coming out of the leasing JV, I think, was over the 

           18    course of several years -- of the time, four or five 

           19    years, was like $25 million.  So given the 

           20    immateriality of the amount in conjunction with the 

           21    additional provisions that were in the leasing JV 

           22    agreement, we just decided to take a more 

           23    conservative approach on that and we did not include 

           24    that as part of our nonbusiness refund claim that we 

           25    filed.  

           26             MR. BRANNAN:  Here's what's interesting 

           27    about that discussion -- 

           28             MS. HARKEY:  If you could speak in the 




                                                                    71




                                                                      


            1    microphone.  

            2             MR. BRANNAN:  I'm sorry.  

            3             Here's what's interesting about that 

            4    discussion.  All of the things that Ms. Mirandi just 

            5    described, or should I say none of the things that 

            6    Ms. Mirandi just described were present in the 

            7    investment relationship with CCB.  And those are the 

            8    things that are important.  They're important under 

            9    the law; what sort of control, what sort of input.  

           10             And -- and -- and so it's a -- you know, 

           11    it's a facts and circumstances test at the end of 

           12    the day.  And we have a taxpayer who's trying to do 

           13    the best we can.  And to suggest that somehow a 

           14    decision made, an honest evaluation here should 

           15    somehow hang us up over here on the other side, I 

           16    think it's -- it's not really the way the analysis 

           17    is supposed to work.  

           18             So we did what we did.  Honestly we look at 

           19    it today, we still think it's the right call.  But 

           20    with regard to the impact of the leasing JV in 

           21    connection or its impact on the rest of the 

           22    investment, we had the person we're investing in 

           23    telling us, "We want you to join us."  Mr. Smilie.  

           24    We didn't think we had much choice.  Who's helping 

           25    who in that situation?  I mean we're just stuck at 

           26    that point.  It's not what we wanted.  It's not why 

           27    we started the investment.  It's really just 

           28    something that was kind of foisted upon us during 




                                                                    72




                                                                      


            1    the course of business.  

            2             MR. SPERRING:  It was just emphasized, 

            3    right, it was 5 percent.  So kick in another 5 

            4    percent, if you will.  

            5             MR. BRANNAN:  Right.  I mean the amount of 

            6    the investment was roughly 5 percent of that, you 

            7    know the larger initial investment.  So it's -- you 

            8    know, it's part of -- it's part of the deal with 

            9    them.  They took expertise, and in exchange we got a 

           10    chance to invest in the market.  It always comes 

           11    back to the same thing, it really does.  

           12             MS. STOWERS:  Thank you.  

           13             MS. HARKEY:  Member Ma?  

           14             MS. MA:  Okay.  So I think, you know, the 

           15    Franchise Tax Board, as I hear, you're basing the 

           16    case on operational ties.  

           17             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Yes.  

           18             MS. MA:  Right.  And the taxpayer is really 

           19    basing it on whether it's integral, inseparable, 

           20    right?  

           21             MR. BRANNAN:  Interwoven.  

           22             MS. MA:  Integral parts, interwoven with 

           23    the company's trade or business.  

           24             MR. SPERRING:  Yeah, the Hoechst Celanese 

           25    language.  

           26             MS. MA:  Right.  

           27             So, how is this different from, like, a 

           28    equity investor where the equity investor invests, 




                                                                    73




                                                                      


            1    takes a certain percentage, puts someone on a board 

            2    of directors, you know, is actively engaged in the 

            3    operations and the management of the company because 

            4    they have a stake in the company?  

            5             I think -- I mean, in my opinion it's 

            6    almost like it's like a equity investor, except 

            7    there's a little twist in it in that the equity 

            8    investor really just goes in just for the investment 

            9    and doesn't have any sort of relationship with the 

           10    company that they're investing in.  

           11             And in this case, because you both are 

           12    banks, you know, I think it's a little different 

           13    because there is operational ties, I think, in why 

           14    you did what you did in terms of investing, 

           15    expanding, you know, your footprint.  

           16             But, you know, I'm trying to -- you know, 

           17    I'm not convinced that this is like an integral, 

           18    interwoven, indivisible, inseparable from Bank of 

           19    America's business, because it wasn't initially part 

           20    of, you know, the market.  It was like an 

           21    investment.  It didn't turn out necessarily to do 

           22    much because China controls all of their business 

           23    operations in China.  

           24             And so in terms of, you know, having it be 

           25    interwoven into the fabric, I'm trying to get there 

           26    and I'm trying to figure it out.  But it doesn't -- 

           27    it's not rising to that level in my opinion.  

           28             So, Franchise Tax Board.  




                                                                    74




                                                                      


            1             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Well, I would say that 

            2    the operational tie language that we used was all 

            3    the Board opinions from the '80s and '90s were 

            4    affirmed with approval in Celanese.  So the Celanese 

            5    court was endorsing the position of your Board in 

            6    CTS Keene, which requires operational ties.  

            7             I should also point out that with the whole 

            8    "interwoven, integral, complete" language, that's 

            9    like at the top of page 532 of Celanese.  And if you 

           10    go, like, two paragraphs down, they say that, we 

           11    conclude that forming these interpretations of the 

           12    statutory language into a cohesive whole, we 

           13    conclude that income is business income under the 

           14    functional test if the taxpayer's acquisition, 

           15    control, and use of the property contribute 

           16    materially to the taxpayer's production of the 

           17    business income.  

           18             So that's where Celanese ac -- that's where 

           19    Celanese ends up after they talk about that language 

           20    about interweaving and interwoven.  They end up 

           21    going back to language very similar to CTS Keene 

           22    which is contributing materially to the production 

           23    of business income, operational function, that sort 

           24    of language.  

           25             MS. MA:  Okay.  Okay.  So let's go back to 

           26    material.  How is the investment material to the 

           27    overall Bank of America -- 

           28             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  In Celanese -- 




                                                                    75




                                                                      


            1             MS. MA:  -- portfolio?  

            2             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Sorry.  

            3             In Celanese they use materiality in a 

            4    qualitative sense.  They're talking about the 

            5    pension reversion being part -- a material part of 

            6    Celanese business because employees are material to 

            7    the business of Celanese.  

            8             Here we're talking about market 

            9    exploitation, and markets are clearly -- you know, 

           10    markets are clearly material to any business.  So 

           11    there was never a quantitative materiality test.  

           12             And if you end up -- and as in the 

           13    hearing -- as the hearing summary discussed, if you 

           14    use a quantitative test for materiality, you can end 

           15    up in a situation where nothing that ever happens 

           16    for Wyoming is ever material because it's such a 

           17    small part of any company's business.  

           18             MS. MA:  It's a judgment.  

           19             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  So material -- 

           20             MS. MA:  A judgment. 

           21             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Materiality has to be 

           22    qualitative.  

           23             MS. MA:  Okay.  

           24             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Yeah, it's qualitative.  

           25             MS. MA:  Qualitative, okay.  

           26             MR. BRANNAN:  If I may.  

           27             MS. MA:  Yeah.  

           28             MR. BRANNAN:  The problem with what the FTB 




                                                                    76




                                                                      


            1    counsel just said is he's focusing on language from 

            2    one aspect of the decision, specifically the 

            3    materiality language.  

            4             Well, the case also defines materiality.  

            5    To say that we have that sort of material 

            6    contribution, when the business is inseparable and 

            7    interwoven -- and I apologize, I'm sure I'm getting 

            8    one of those words wrong.  But going to the 

            9    qualitative discussion, I think it's, you know, 

           10    first point qualitative is good, but it's got to be 

           11    informed at some level by the metrics.  

           12             And second part, when we talk about what 

           13    the court says, it's defining the word integral and 

           14    it sets out basically three parts.  For the 

           15    functional test you have to have control in use over 

           16    the property, that it has to contribute materially 

           17    to the production of business income, and then it 

           18    has to be integral.  Which it then goes on to 

           19    decide -- you know, define -- 

           20             Again, there's too many words, that's why I 

           21    had to write it down at the beginning, I'm sorry.  

           22    But the property is integral when it's so interwoven 

           23    into the fabric of the taxpayer's business.  Again, 

           24    we keep going back to the same thing and it becomes 

           25    indivisible and inseparable.  

           26             What the court's trying to say is we want 

           27    it to be part of the business because that's the 

           28    test at the end of the day.  If it's part of the 




                                                                    77




                                                                      


            1    business California has the unitary method.  If it's 

            2    part of the business, we apportion it amongst the 

            3    states or amongst the countries, you know worldwide, 

            4    all that good stuff.  But that's what's not here.  

            5             You know, Mr. Smilie testified on the 

            6    leasing joint venture and I appreciate that that's 

            7    problematic.  I mean we're not hiding from anything.  

            8    I got the right people here.  They can talk about it 

            9    as long as we want, but at the end of the day it was 

           10    set up as a stand-alone business.  It wasn't part of 

           11    our global leasing operations.  We treated it as 

           12    equity investment.  We held it separately.  We 

           13    didn't want to be there.  I mean it was never going 

           14    to be part of our business.  

           15             If it had really taken off, I mean put in a 

           16    hypothetical, if it had really taken off, I'm gonna 

           17    just go out on a limb and say the Chinese government 

           18    and CCB would have wanted us out.  And in fact 

           19    that's kind of what happened.  They wanted to 

           20    improve the revenues to grow the numbers so that 

           21    when they showed their leasing operations against 

           22    those of the other banks, "Look how we're doing, 

           23    we're doing great, look at our numbers," ignoring 

           24    the risk.  

           25             Well, let's go back to the initial 

           26    introduction of the case.  That's what got them in 

           27    trouble in the first place, twenty years of making 

           28    friendly loans and artificially inflating kind of 




                                                                    78




                                                                      


            1    those numbers.  And all of a sudden they needed that 

            2    outsider to come in and provide the training and 

            3    help modernize and stabilize their banking system.  

            4             It's -- it is a little different from the 

            5    traditional invest money in the market so to speak, 

            6    no question.  But we didn't get that opportunity.  

            7    It goes to John's earlier example.  We were the 

            8    bank.  We had the knowledge.  And so there's a short 

            9    population of investors that really would meet those 

           10    qualifications.  We gave them money, we gave them 

           11    expertise, and in exchange we got the opportunity to 

           12    invest in the market.  

           13             So I'm trying to respond to many of the 

           14    points that you just kind of walked through, and 

           15    hopefully I just did that.  

           16             MS. MA:  I get it.  No, I understand China 

           17    very well.  And I understand their business model 

           18    and how they operate.  

           19             MR. BRANNAN:  I understand.  Understood.  

           20             MS. MA:  I get it.  

           21             MR. BRANNAN:  Understood.  

           22             MS. HARKEY:  Ms. Ma -- 

           23             MS. MA:  I'm glad you -- 

           24             MS. HARKEY:  -- you understand China?  

           25             MS. MA:  I do, unfortunately, yes.  

           26             MR. BRANNAN:  My apologies.  

           27             MS. MA:  I've taken delegations back since 

           28    1999.  




                                                                    79




                                                                      


            1             MR. BRANNAN:  Perfect.  

            2             MS. MA:  So yes.  And I understand that's 

            3    their business model.  And that's where I'm having a 

            4    little difficulty because when you invest in China, 

            5    it'll never be integral to your business.  It is 

            6    China's business.  That's how it is.  It is their 

            7    business and they need you for their intellectual 

            8    expertise until they get to that level where they 

            9    don't need you anymore.  That's how it works.  

           10             MS. HARKEY:  Anymore questions?  

           11             MR. HORTON:  Question of the Department, 

           12    Madam Chair.  

           13             MS. HARKEY:  Yes.  Member Horton.  

           14             MR. HORTON:  You seem to distinguish the 

           15    measurement of materiality from the definition in 

           16    Hoechst Celanese.  Relative to the definition, the 

           17    use of the term interwoven, indivisible, 

           18    inseparable, why do you believe that's there?  

           19             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  That's -- what happened 

           20    in Celanese is the court was affirming a bunch of 

           21    precedent that had been created by your Board over 

           22    the course of decades.  And the language of 

           23    interwoven and inseparable actually came from Holly 

           24    Sugar, which was the very first case.  And they -- 

           25    they were affirming everything that had happened, 

           26    and they just used that nice language from the very 

           27    beginning.  And at the same time they then said but 

           28    we're also in accord with everything that the Board 




                                                                    80




                                                                      


            1    has done from the '80s and '90s.  

            2             And if you look back at Holly Sugar, it was 

            3    actually a unitary case.  The cases that we would 

            4    see as business income/nonbusiness income really 

            5    came much later.  So they were affirming -- they 

            6    were actually taking language from old, old unity 

            7    cases and applying it, applying it to a 

            8    business/nonbusiness income case and then saying 

            9    "and by the way, everything your Board has decided 

           10    on business/nonbusiness income cases over the last 

           11    20 years is very good."  

           12             So that's how that language got in there.  

           13    But as they affirmed the Board decisions of the '80s 

           14    and '90s, not all those cases actually requires, you 

           15    know, profound interweaving.  If you look at CTS 

           16    Keene, which was the last decision your Board had on 

           17    minority stock cases, it's about material 

           18    contribution and operational value and operational 

           19    ties.  

           20             MR. HORTON:  So let's -- let's -- let's 

           21    take a look at material contribution and operational 

           22    ties.  The dividend transaction.  

           23             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  The taxable transaction?  

           24             MR. HORTON:  Right.  How did that give B of 

           25    A any control over or any contractual influence over 

           26    the operations in China?  

           27             I understand the relationship.  I mean I 

           28    understand the relationship that was developed as a 




                                                                    81




                                                                      


            1    result of the partnership.  Is that sufficient in 

            2    your mind because they now have a relationship, that 

            3    that relationship stems to other relationships?  

            4             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  That would be consistent 

            5    with your Board's precedent that where an -- I mean 

            6    because ultimately in the functional business test, 

            7    and I'm sure this is undisputed -- 

            8             MR. HORTON:  I'm speaking of a relationship 

            9    if I loaned you $5 -- 

           10             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Okay.  

           11             MR. HORTON:  -- you know, we would have 

           12    some sort of a relationship.  But I couldn't tell 

           13    you what to do, and you certainly couldn't tell me 

           14    what to do.  

           15             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  No, sir.  

           16             The question -- we're talking about the 

           17    functional test, and ultimately the question is 

           18    about the asset at issue, so that would be the 

           19    stock.  

           20             MR. HORTON:  Controlling the asset in order 

           21    to influence the business activity.  

           22             MR. LO GROSSMAN:  Yeah.  The question is -- 

           23    the test is, does that asset serve an operational 

           24    function to the taxpayer before you?  And 

           25    appellant -- Bank of America -- so the question is 

           26    whether -- what is Bank of America getting out of 

           27    its stock interest in China Construction Bank, and 

           28    does it have an operational value to China 




                                                                    82




                                                                      


            1    Construction Bank?  And appellant's officers say 

            2    that it did.  And their press releases say that it 

            3    did.  And we believe appellant's contemporaneous 

            4    documentation.  And we've put our case forward on 

            5    that basis.  

            6             Did you have a different question?  

            7             MR. HORTON:  No.  

            8             MS. HARKEY:  Okay, Members, do I hear a 

            9    motion?  

           10             Member Runner?  

           11             MR. RUNNER:  Yeah, I am, at least from my 

           12    observation that I would see that B of A's 

           13    involvement, I guess I see as incidental to their 

           14    investment, does not come up to the controlling 

           15    aspects and what I would understand as certainly the 

           16    operational ties.  

           17             So, you know, I think obviously there's 

           18    some -- there's some involvement.  The question is, 

           19    to what degree is that involvement?  And to me, 

           20    especially the issue that how easily it was to just 

           21    divest of the involvement indicates to me that it 

           22    was not a very integral part of their portfolio -- 

           23    not their -- shouldn't say their portfolio, but 

           24    their -- but their operation.  So I would make a 

           25    motion for a claim -- or approve their claim for 

           26    refund.  

           27             MS. HARKEY:  Is there a second?  

           28             I will second.  




                                                                    83




                                                                      


            1             Is there objection?  

            2             MS. STOWERS:  Objection.  

            3             MS. HARKEY:  An objection.

           15             MS. RICHMOND:  Motion carries.  

           16             MS. HARKEY:  4-1.  Thank you.

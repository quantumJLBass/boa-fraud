and so, in the filings for the defendant, is the court's statement true? don't summarize what the court is saying, look to the filings and validate what the statement is saying and explain what and why and where. you are not asked what the court thinks or said... you are to look to the defendants filings and find if there is anything that is at odds with the statements that the court made.












strictly review the defendant's filings to identify any evidence or statements that contradict or are at odds with the court’s assertions. Let’s analyze each part of the court’s statement step by step against the filings.

Court's Statement 1:
"Defendant Bass continues to assert there was collusion, but again fails to support this argument with evidence."

Defendant's Filings:
Chat Logs with Glenda Morlan (Exhibit A):

The defendant provides Facebook messages where Glenda Morlan discusses the auction being "rigged" and mentions coercion to sell before the auction.
Relevant Quotes:
“The mortgage company will buy it... and then auction it off again to recap all expenses.”
“Right now, your only chance to get out without a foreclosure... is to do a quick sell and because of time it will have to be cash.”
Analysis: While these statements suggest insider knowledge of improper auction practices, the court claims a failure to connect Morlan to the Plaintiffs. However, the defendant clearly presents these logs to argue that someone had knowledge of the Plaintiffs' conduct, which challenges the court’s dismissal that there is “no evidence.”
At Odds: Yes, the defendant does provide evidence alleging misconduct, though the direct link is not fully explicit.
Exhibit B: Recorded Audio Call:

Defendant references an audio recording where Morlan discusses irregularities in the auction and intimidation tactics.
Analysis: Defendant’s evidence of this conversation shows someone knowledgeable about the auction process speaking about its manipulation.
At Odds: The court’s statement that no evidence supports collusion is at odds with this audio transcript and recording, which at minimum raises factual questions regarding collusion or irregularities.
Court's Statement 2:
"Defendant Bass provided messaging communication he had with an individual named Glenda Morlan, but he fails to connect Morlan to the Plaintiffs."

Defendant's Filings:
The defendant alleges pre-auction misconduct, and while Morlan may not directly state her connection to the Plaintiffs, her repeated assertions that the auction would be manipulated implies third-party coordination.
Connection through Circumstantial Evidence:
Defendant describes Morlan’s statements in conjunction with pre-printed checks matching the auction result.
This circumstantial evidence (pre-arranged bids + Morlan’s statements) could reasonably infer involvement of the Plaintiffs.
At Odds: While not a direct connection, the court’s dismissal of these communications overlooks the weight of circumstantial evidence provided in the filings.

Court's Statement 3:
"Defendant Bass also provided video clips of the sale, but again, Defendant Bass fails to show that there were any issues with the sale."

Defendant's Filings:
Video Evidence of the Auction (Exhibit C):

Defendant provides videos showing:
Pre-printed checks matching the winning bid amount, which he argues demonstrates pre-arranged bidding.
Lack of competitive bidding.
Conduct of the auctioneer and Plaintiffs’ representatives that raises questions about the fairness of the auction.
Analysis: The presence of pre-printed checks matching the final bid is highly unusual and goes directly to Defendant’s argument of collusion and misconduct. The court dismisses this as a “common practice” per Breckenridge, but the Defendant’s evidence challenges whether this practice was fair or legal in his case.
At Odds: The court’s conclusion that the videos show “no issues” ignores Defendant’s clear evidence of irregularities, specifically pre-printed bid amounts and lack of competition, which reasonably raises concerns about collusion.

Court's Statement 4:
"Bass contends that the fact that the Plaintiffs' representative had a check with the exact amount is evidence of collusion, however, this is simply a conclusory statement with no supporting evidence."

Defendant's Filings:
Pre-Printed Checks:
Defendant argues the existence of pre-printed checks matching the final bid demonstrates a pre-determined outcome.
The Defendant explicitly ties this to:
The trustee’s fiduciary duty to ensure a fair auction.
Evidence of communication prior to the auction (Exhibit A and B).
Supporting Analysis:
Pre-printed checks are not inherently proof of collusion, but coupled with:
Morlan’s admissions of a rigged auction,
Lack of other competitive bids (observed in video evidence),
the Defendant provides supporting evidence beyond mere conclusory statements.
At Odds: The court’s characterization of this as “conclusory with no supporting evidence” contradicts the Defendant’s presented filings, which include multiple forms of corroborating evidence (chat logs, audio, and video).

Conclusion:
The court’s assertions that Defendant Bass “fails to support” claims of collusion or issues with the sale are at odds with the evidence presented in the filings. Specifically:

Chat logs and audio recordings from Glenda Morlan allege auction manipulation and insider coordination.
Video evidence showing pre-printed checks and lack of competitive bidding raises valid factual questions about collusion.
The Defendant provides circumstantial evidence that supports his allegations, challenging the court’s dismissal of his claims as unsupported or conclusory.
In summary, Defendant Bass’s filings do contain evidence that challenges the fairness of the auction and raises questions of collusion, which the court’s opinion appears to overlook or dismiss prematurely.

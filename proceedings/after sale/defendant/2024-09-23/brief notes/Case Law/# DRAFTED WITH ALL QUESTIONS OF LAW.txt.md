### **GROUNDS FOR APPEAL**

The trial court committed the following errors of law and procedure:

1. **Failure to Consider Evidence Timely Filed and Referenced Under IRCP 10(c):**
    
    - The trial court erred by refusing to consider **Defendant’s Filings Sections C, D, and E**, submitted on October 21, 2024, as part of the Motion for Reconsideration.
    - Under **IRCP 10(c)**, these filings were explicitly incorporated by reference and should have been considered.
    - The court’s dismissal of these filings as "previously presented" is erroneous because the filings were unconsidered during summary judgment.

2. **Misapplication of Idaho Code § 45-1508:**
    
    - The court misapplied protections for "bona fide purchasers" under **§ 45-1508**. Defendant raised substantive defects (e.g., collusion, lack of valid default) that void the foreclosure sale _ab initio_, removing protections under this statute.
    - The court failed to distinguish between procedural errors (curable) and substantive defects (voiding the sale), as clarified in **Baker v. Nationstar Mortg., LLC**.

3. **Failure to Address Evidence of Collusion and Pre-Auction Misconduct:**
    
    - Defendant presented evidence of:
        - Pre-printed checks matching auction bids.
        - Testimony and statements (e.g., Glenda Morlan) alleging pre-coordinated bidding and auction rigging.
        - Videos showing auction irregularities undermining competitive fairness.
    - The court dismissed this evidence as “conclusory” without substantive analysis, ignoring circumstantial evidence that raises material factual disputes.

4. **Procedural Due Process Violations:**
    
    - The court violated due process by summarily excluding critical evidence, including:
        - Defendant’s videos and audio recordings.
        - Emails regarding trustee misconduct.
    - The exclusion contravenes the standards under **IRCP 11.2(b)(1)** for motions for reconsideration, which allow for previously unreviewed evidence to be considered.

5. **Failure to Address Trustee Breach of Fiduciary Duty (Idaho Code § 45-1506):**
    
    - Defendant alleged the trustee failed to:
        - Conduct a fair and impartial auction.
        - Prevent pre-auction misconduct and collusion.
    - The court ignored these arguments, which constitute breaches of the trustee’s obligations under **§ 45-1506**.

6. **Misapplication of Legal Precedent in Breckenridge Property Fund:**
    
    - The court erroneously relied on _Breckenridge_ to justify pre-printed checks, without distinguishing Defendant’s evidence of pre-arranged bidding outcomes and collusion.

7. **Striking Plaintiff’s Inappropriate Statements and Misrepresentations:**
    
    - The court erred by failing to address Defendant’s **Motion to Strike Inappropriate Statements**, which identified false, inflammatory, and prejudicial footnotes and allegations in Plaintiff’s filings.
    - Under **IRCP 12(f)**, the court has a duty to strike scandalous or misleading material.

8. **Conflict Between State Law and Federal Antitrust Laws (Sherman Act):**
    
    - Defendant raised concerns that pre-auction private agreements violated federal antitrust laws under the Sherman Act, undermining fair competition.
    - The court failed to reconcile these claims with Idaho Code § 45-1506 and § 45-1508.

9. **Improper Burden of Proof:**

- The court improperly shifted the burden to Defendant at the summary judgment stage, requiring conclusive proof of collusion rather than recognizing that circumstantial evidence creates a genuine issue of material fact.

### **QUESTIONS OF LAW PRESENTED FOR APPEAL**

1. Does Idaho Code § 45-1508 shield or protect a purchaser in cases involving substantive defects, such as collusion or lack of default?
 - Idaho courts (e.g., Baker v. Nationstar) have ruled that § 45-1508 protections only apply to procedural defects. Substantive issues void the sale entirely​
2. Did the court err by refusing to consider timely incorporated filings under IRCP 10(c) as “new evidence” in a motion for reconsideration? Or in other words, Did the trial court violate IRCP 10(c) and 59(e) by refusing to consider new filings and evidence incorporated by reference in a Motion for Reconsideration?
 - Relevant Rules:
    - IRCP 10(c): Documents referenced are considered part of the pleadings.
    - IRCP 59(e): Allows reconsideration based on newly discovered evidence or manifest errors.
  2.a Does Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 11.2(b)(1) require a court to consider unreviewed evidence as “new evidence” in a motion for reconsideration?
    - The trial court admitted it did not consider Sections C, D, and E at summary judgment but dismissed them as “reiterated facts.”
    - Question of Law: Are previously unconsidered filings treated as “new evidence” under IRCP 11.2(b)(1)?
3. Can the trustee’s sale remain valid under § 45-1508 if there is evidence of pre-auction collusion or rigging?
 - The statute requires a “good faith purchaser.” Pre-auction rigging or collusion would negate this status, stripping away protections​
4. Does Idaho Code § 45-1508 create a conflict with federal laws like the Sherman Act when private pre-auction negotiations occur?
 - While § 45-1508 promotes finality, it cannot supersede federal law, such as Sherman Act principles prohibiting anti-competitive practices in public auctions​
 - The issue remains whether Idaho law implicitly tolerates pre-auction coordination or bid rigging, which conflicts with federal fair-trade principles.
5. Does § 45-1508 permit pre-printed or pre-coordinated checks as part of the foreclosure sale?
 - While Breckenridge clarified that checks conforming to sale conditions are permissible, it did not validate pre-arranged bids or auction rigging that eliminate competitive fairness​
6. Does § 45-1508 override challenges to the legitimacy of default as a substantive issue?
 - If no valid default exists, the sale is void ab initio, and § 45-1508 cannot shield the purchaser​
7. Does procedural fairness under IRCP 11.2(b)(1) require courts to consider unreviewed evidence in motions for reconsideration?
8. Did the court err by dismissing circumstantial evidence of collusion and auction misconduct as conclusory, contrary to Idaho evidentiary standards?
9. Did the court fail to apply Idaho Code § 45-1506(11) regarding the trustee’s breach of fiduciary duty in ensuring a fair auction process?
10. Are any private one on one non-public pre-foreclosure conversations that could undermine open bidding at auction void as against public policy under Idaho Code Title 45?
11. Does equitable relief, such as setting aside a foreclosure sale, apply when misconduct (e.g., collusion, fraud, or failure to meet statutory notice requirements) is proven?
12. Do statutory rights of redemption under Idaho Code §§ 45-113 and 45-114 apply when a foreclosure sale is contested for procedural defects or allegations of collusion?
13. Does the improper application of legal precedent, such as Breckenridge Property Fund and Baker v. Nationstar, constitute reversible error when substantive defects void a foreclosure sale?
 - Analysis: Misapplication of legal precedent can result in reversible error if it affects the validity of the foreclosure.
14. Did the trial court improperly conflate procedural fairness for pro se litigants with substantive due process obligations?
 - The court relied on Michalk v. Michalk to emphasize procedural compliance but failed to address substantive arguments regarding auction irregularities.
 - Question of Law: Does procedural compliance for pro se litigants absolve the court of its duty to address substantive legal claims?
15. Did the trial court misinterpret the burden of proof by requiring Defendant to prove collusion conclusively at the summary judgment stage, contrary to Idaho standards for material factual disputes?
 - Under Idaho law, a motion for summary judgment fails where there is a genuine dispute of material fact.
 - Question of Law: Did the court improperly shift the burden of proof by dismissing circumstantial evidence of collusion as “unsupported”?
16. Did the trial court err by failing to address the trustee’s breach of fiduciary duties under Idaho Code § 45-1506?
 - The trustee’s role includes ensuring a fair and impartial auction. Defendant presented evidence that the trustee engaged in conduct undermining the sale’s integrity.
 - Question of Law: Does a trustee’s failure to ensure competitive bidding and impartiality constitute a breach that voids the sale?
17. Did the trial court misapply Breckenridge Property Fund v. Wally Enterprises by equating pre-printed checks with common trustee sale practices, despite Defendant’s evidence of pre-determined outcomes?
 - Defendant distinguished his case from Breckenridge by highlighting pre-printed checks with exact bid amounts as evidence of collusion.
 - Question of Law: Does Breckenridge provide blanket protection for pre-printed checks, or must courts assess their impact on auction fairness on a case-by-case basis?
18. Does the existence of a binding verbal payoff agreement and partial performance negate a default under Idaho contract law (Idaho Code § 9-503, § 29-110)?
 - Defendant argued that Carrington Mortgage Services breached a verbal payoff agreement, supported by partial performance (e.g., payment of taxes and insurance).
 - Question of Law: Can partial performance and verbal agreements, recognized under Idaho law, invalidate claims of default and the resulting foreclosure sale?
19. Did the trial court fail to address procedural due process concerns by excluding key evidence (e.g., videos, communications) that challenge the integrity of the auction process?
 - The exclusion of video and audio evidence provided by Defendant raises questions about fairness.
 - Question of Law: Did the trial court violate due process by summarily dismissing evidence without substantive review?
20. Did the trial court err by dismissing evidence of pre-printed checks and communications as “conclusory,” thereby failing to properly weigh circumstantial evidence of collusion?
 - Idaho law allows for circumstantial evidence to support claims of collusion, particularly where pre-arranged bids undermine fair and public auctions.
 - Question of Law: Did the court improperly disregard circumstantial evidence that raises material factual disputes about auction fairness?

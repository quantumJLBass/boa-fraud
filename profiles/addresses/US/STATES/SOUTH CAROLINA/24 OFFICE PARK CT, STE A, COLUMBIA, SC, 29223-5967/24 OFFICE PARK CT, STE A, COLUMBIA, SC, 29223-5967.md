Imagine having strangers show up to your house, uninvited/unalerted, to do work that you never requested. That's what life is like with their maintenance. They come at random times to do work that should have been done before assigning tenants to the house. It is uncomfortable, an inconvenience and invasive to say the least.

my lease is up in november and I cannot wait to move. the company wants to charge for maintenance done to the home, even if it was done from previous tenants. I wouldn't be surprised if they try charging me for outlandish things when I move out. I do not recommend renting from them at all. 0/10. Also they will lie on the portal about invoices. they wanted to charge me $110 for someone coming to plunge the toilet but the invoice from the company said $100. not tripping over $10 but seriously and if you do want to rent from them and renew the lease, the lease renewal is like $125 or something like that. MONEY HUNGRY. update: I'm finally moved out and this company is still trash. they charged an outrageous amount of things to be taken out of the deposit. also they have two homes in a horrible/dangerous neighborhood. DO NOT RECOMMEND!

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your experience with us. We take all feedback seriously and value the opportunity to address your concerns. We're sorry to hear that you're not satisfied with your current leasing experience. We understand that maintenance charges can be a source of frustration. Our aim is always to maintain our properties in the best possible condition for our tenants. Regarding maintenance costs, we follow industry standards, and charges are typically based on the nature of the repair and the associated costs incurred. As for lease renewal fees, it's common practice in the industry to charge a renewal fee to cover administrative costs associated with renewing a lease. We will, however, review our fee structure to ensure it remains competitive and fair. We genuinely care about our tenants' experiences and are committed to addressing your concerns. Please feel free to reach out to us at 803-403-8838 to discuss any specific issues you've encountered further. We want to work with you to ensure a better experience going forward.

I have worked with a lot of property management companies in Columbia and Real Property Management of the Midlands is the best hands down. They are responsive, knowledgeable, and very helpful when it comes to dealing with rental properties and tenant management. Ben and his team will take great care of you! I highly recommend contacting them if you are thinking about renting a property in the Midlands.

This is one the worst places I've ever rented from. I have gotten several charges on my account for no reason at all due to them wanting to just get money this month alone I've had 320.00 worth of charges on my account for no reason at all. They said that my grass was too high and I had a car in my yard that was inoperable but that wasn't true at all. They have came and did inspections in my house several times to the point where it feel like harassment all because they want to try to find a reason to tack on more fees. I have mold in my bathroom because there is no ventilation in there and I was told that if they send someone out to check it then I was responsible for having to pay the maintenance. By law in SC mold is to be address by the lessor. I will be calling the bbb and cdc if the issue is not handled correctly. I have children and mold makes them sick. My light bill has always been high since moving here because of poor ventilation in the house. I moved here to Columbia in June of 2023 and I will say that this has been the worst experience with a landlord I could possibly have. The house is in a bad neighborhood there is always some shooting happening here and they act as if I'm in a luxury home. It's really saddening that I moved to start a new life in another city and my experience has been the worst I am so ready to move and leave this place behind. I cannot even be comfortable in the home I pay rent in because they want to come and harass me every couple of weeks. My heart goes out to the future tenants of this company because they are going to try to take every dollar they can from you while renting from them!

They keep the lines of communication open for any questions or concerns. The turnaround time for renting the property was amazing.

Try finding another company before choosing this "Property Management Company" and below are the reasons why. 1. Communication doesn't exist with this company! The associates at this company don't communicate with each other! 2. You call the office, no answer! You leave a message no one will return your call! 3. If you do get someone to answer the phone. They don't stick to their word! (Darrell) 4. They will tell you one thing but do something totally different! 5. They'll send you a text saying that they need something from you but don't give you a deadline! 6. I was told which water company I needed to use but they gave me the wrong info! 7. I got the keys to the house on a Friday night. I received a text on the following Monday from their office stating that I need to turn in the "INVENTORY AND CONDITION FORM" but was told when it needed to be turned in. On Wednesday I received another text from their office stating that if I didn't turn the form by Thursday that it wouldn't be accepted! Information like this should have been passed to me when I got the keys, didn't happen (Jasmine)! 8. Over all my initial experience with this company is TRASH!!!!!!!!!!

Communication was great until I had tenants in my property. Now it takes days to get a response from the team. I'm not updated on the status of work orders or the condition of my property. The services they provide are expensive compared to other services but the customer service isn't great unless the manager gets involved.

Jasmine is who I dealt with from the beginning of our process and she was absolutely wonderful and professional! Later we then spoke to Marilou and Daryl, very kind and professional and they all help guide us through our process and were very prompt getting back with us when needed. Updating my review to 2 stars because I asked if we could enter the home to clean b4 the move in & we were told by Jasmine at lease signing that our home would be cleaned and maintenance would do any necessary repairs as well as them doing a last walk through to check before we moved in. She assured us that everything would be cleaned by their vendor. I'm disgusted to say that every bug, dust, dirt, stained carpet and spiderweb that we seen when we viewed the home was there on move in day. When asked she told us it's because we picked our key up before 12 but THEY (Daryl) are the ones who told us to pick the keys up and it was after 10am. Also the maintenance issues that we noticed were still untouched on move in. They told us they needed at least 5 days to clean and repair. I'm not sure what they even did but play us. Maintenance manager Joy told us we signed a "As Is" lease but the lease mention request what we want and they would take in consideration but it was already told to us that they always clean before leasing. The lease mentions that they want PAID professionals to clean at move out but we received it dirty. Interesting‚Ä¶.

This is my 1st time ever dealing with this company, and definitely my last one. Reasons of 1st they don't respond back is a reasonable time. I was having to email and leave voice messages and drove 35 mins there and back to get something done. Marilou tried to cover herself by saying after i talk to you i will send a text that we talk and to have this certain paper work. And thats all i will need and you will be on your way. So 2nd i drove to that home i was interested in leasing and only to find the sign was removed and off the website while I was still waiting to see if I got approved. 3rd they pulled my back ground check that night around 8pm. While I found out the next day from Jassmin they have already lease the home that Wednesday morning. After having to call several time and asking the to speak to Darryl. He tried to tell me about credit in reason why other ppl would get approved. I told him I wasn't even given a fair chance. My credit was almost 700 and I make 3 times of what they wanted to see for the asking lease price of the house for lease. My past rental location I never ever was late in 3yrs. I had a couple minor neg on my credit that was fraud. But under the $300 dollars. This company do not offer a fair opportunity. They are making money off of your application $75 application process then another per application $25 they make it hard to get approved. And when they ask you all kinds of questions. They are scamming many ppl. Just imagine 20 ppl put in a application that's 2,000 dollars. This company then tells me I'm not approved after i complain about my experience. So I ask the manager why you ran a back ground check after you have already had it in leasing. He said so u may get into another house. Like really how u going to do that when my application clearly ask for that address. They are full of it.. So the only way to get into there rental lease you have to have a 700 or more, make more the 6,000 dollars and your rental history really don't matter. I later called back many times asking for a explanation of my application not getting approved. It say because of credit, income not proved. (Clearly it was and was signed by my manager) and tenant history. Which was perfect no late history. ( They never even call my Pervious rental company to check the history they said. He was like we been waiting for 6 days and nothing. So don't lease any homes under this name. They are full of it.

We certainly regret your experience while applying with us. Our application fee is $50 per applicant. We do not assess a $75 application fee. We pride ourselves in giving every applicant a fair opportunity to rent any property we manage. However when a property receives multiple applications, only one applicant can move forward into said property. If an applicant is approved but the home they applied for is no longer available, we will offer to transfer the approved application to another rental we offer at no additional cost. Daryl would be happy to speak with you personally regarding your application.

Stay Away!!! They do not care about renters; they only care about charging superfluous fees to make money. If you are a homeowner, they will let your house crumble to the ground because doing any maintenance cost money.

It is a common practice to market a property for rent while it is still occupied. This is how we help keep vacancies low for our clients.

this company is horrible. all they want is the money. i put in a maintenance requests for issues we're with the washing machine. the first time a technician came out he said that the tub in the washer is just sitting in there and he's surprised it can even spin. he said he'd let them know that he recommends replacement. here we are two months later, the washer doesn't spin at all. i made another maintenance request. they had whoever tell me we're causing the problem by overloading the washing machine.. i'm washing days worth of kids clothes at a time, there's no way. what do they do? cancel the request. i'm not going to keep asking for the issue to be fixed. i will be filing a complaint with the BBB. i should not be going to a laundromat when i'm renting a home with a washer/dryer connection. if they don't want to replace the junk washer then they can move it out and i can use my own! i also put in a maintenance request for the toilet that has been running non stop. City of Columbia has called me twice to let me know the water meter is registering constant use. request is marked received as of 10/17. no technician assigned, no update. don't be scammed by the photos you see, the properties are not what they make them out to be! money talks. i won't be surprised if this review disappears from public view.

The worse rental/property management company EVER! The maintenance people are horrible. The office staff does not answer the phone. Emails are returned weeks after submission. They had a concrete company come to repair the driveway without ever telling me they driveway was being repaired. I was displaced for several hours waiting to get in my home because they did not communicate to me the company was going to be repairing the driveway. Never ever allow this company to manage your property.

Scam Artist. They have homes online that say available but they really aren't. When you put in your application it will take almost a month for them to process it - only to tell you that the home is not available. Meanwhile multiple brokers email you the same email over and over as if the home is still available then when you call - they don't answer and when they do answer they rush you off the phone.

I understand your concern and frustration. Unfortunately Covid has impacted our office as such that 60% of our staff has been out recently due to a Covid infection. This has unfortunately caused a backlog in processing rental applications. The property you applied for was absolutely available when you applied, but there were multiple applications on it as well. We disclosed this to you prior to you applying. Once the home was rented, we promptly notified you and offered to transfer your application to any of our other rentals. We do apologize for your experience thus far. The Covid pandemic has been wreaking havoc across all facets of our lives. We wish you the best of luck in your search for a new home.

I'm updating my review: Incompetent and dishonest. I would NOT recommend this company! They were unable to collect back-rent from one of my tenants. Their repairman is expensive and lacks communication skills. Their negligence while the house was unoccupied led to a plumbing leak causing severe water damage to my subfloor; which they claimed no responsibility for. Stay away!!

I've been working with RPM Midland for a few years now and I've had a positive experience. They helped manage 13 units and I never had to "Manage" them. Meaning, it was seemless and I received my rent checks every month with little to no issues. We had tenant issues but they quickly addressed any late payments and managed it very well thru until it was resolved. The reason why we moved from the previous management company was mainly due to technology and us being able to receive monthly, quarterly, and annual reports with all the main KPI's you would expect as a property owner. Every year, I didn't have wait long to receive our annual breakdown and it was easy as we got close to filling taxes, etc. Daryl and Denice are absolutely the best folks I've been able to work with with regards to property management. I recommend you giving them a chance to earn your business. If you're looking for a property management company that will provide enough of a positive experience, without having to micro-manage, or consistently get headaches, call them today. Don't wait. Thank you, Daryl and Denice for the great experience.

The right Property Manager is key to a successful investment property. Given the years of experience, the professional communication and the care they take managing each property, Real Property Management of the Midlands is without a doubt, in a league of their own. I stronger encourage all owners interested in renting their property to reach out to RPM of the Midlands and see why they are so highly recommended in the Columbia area.

I just want to start off by saying I never leave bad reviews ever! I try to always give someone the benefit of the doubt but, we rented from real property management -midlands for a year. This was the the WORST experience we have ever had! When we first moved in the house it was disgusting! I swear it had never been cleaned. The back door did not even have a functioning lock! We were promised washer and dryers in the home and I used the washer and dryer one time and the entire washer was fried inside ( past residents had ruined it). I reported it and they told me that was my problem that I would have to fix the washer since it was broken. I went back and forth with the property management people between that and the ice machine in the fridge not working for MONTHS. It got so bad that the owner of the property ,from Germany, had to reach out to us! The owner ended up buying a new washer after us living there with out one for 6 months! The ice machine still broken after we moved out (over a year of not being fixed!). Also every time you try to call, text, or email do NOT expect a response because these are the laziest people. We would call, text and email and would not get a response till weeks later! I will NEVER rent from real property management again! I will advise everyone I meet to not rent from them or use them to rent your home!

We certainly do regret your experience. We were not aware that you were not satisfied with the cleanliness of your home as we did not receive feedback that it wasn't properly cleaned to your satisfaction. We also do ensure that the entire property is properly secured for you. In accordance with the lease agreement, the washer is provided as a courtesy only. Regarding the ice maker in the fridge, we certainly regret that it did take longer than we'd like to address it. We'd been going back and forth with the owner for quite some time with no success. It wasn't until we informed them that we'd have to take drastic action that he got personally involved to address it. In light of that event, we have changed our policy to ensure that such a situation doesn't occur again. We wish you the best moving forward.

Unresponsive to calls, emails and text. The 2 years we leased with them was a nightmare. Daryl tried to take advantage of us financially, please educate yourself on landlord/tenant law before you deal with them. Stay away from any property they are leasing, more trouble and stress than its worth. Very unprofessional, atrocious customer service. Not veteran or Healthcare worker friendly from our experience.

This company is extremely unprofessional with zero customer service. We leased with them almost 2 years with continuous maintenance issues, very difficult to get in touch with anyone. Last summer the pump went out in pool, took 1 month to get fixed, we never got the pool back to being able to swim in safely last summer. The pool pump went out right after we moved in, so again, unable to use. When pool opened this year, numerous issues with pool pump noted and reported. We went without heat for a month back during the winter due to issues with the electricity. The electrical issues continued throughout our stay there. Both bathrooms continuously tripped the breaker and this was reported numerous times. Every single electrical and plumbing person who came and attempted to make repairs commented that the electricity and plumbing were atrocious, was not set up safely or correctly. This was also reported to the landlord and nothing was done. Reported a ceiling leak, the leak was ruining the living room ceiling, was told the leaves on the roof was causing the leak so they patched it but no repairs were made to the ceiling. When we moved in, the place was dirty with spider webs on lights and ceiling fans, a breast pump was located under the bathroom cabinet in the bathroom WITH bodily fluids in it. This was reported. The freezer in the kitchen was filthy and the leasing agent told me she had left a cleaning kit for me to clean it up (paper towels and a small bottle of dish detergent) on move in. So with 2 months left on our lease, we gave them a 30 day notice to find someone else to lease the property with the understanding that we would continue to pay the rent as due until leased. We cleaned the property better than it looked when we moved in, gave the 30 day notice, gave potential renters the information to the leasing company and the owner to assist with renting the property. After all of the above, Real Property Management is demanding to keep our security deposit (although no damage or lost rent) and charging us 3 months rent for "breaking the lease", although there was only 2 months left on our lease, a new renter is in the property without loss of rental income and they raised the rent $400+ more a month for the current renters. My husband is a veteran and is in the healthcare field and I am a nurse working in Long Term Care. We have given and given for our country, our patients and for anyone in need, especially during the pandemic and for this company to behave this way and treat good honest hard working people like second class citizens is beyond my comprehension. Are they that desperate for money? They are non responsive, give horrible customer service and care nothing but about money. FYI, most of the issues were brought to the owner due to the non responsiveness from your company and at the request of the owner. The issues that were reported through your portal AND to the young lady who came for the last inspection went ignored, again, I have all correspondences and were willing to work this out, Also you did not follow the lease as written and on the last communication regarding the lease, we were told due to it being electronic, a paper copy would be sent to us, must have slipped your mind. So just so I understand...You are charging us 3 months rent, $4140, keeping our security deposit $1795. The new renters at least $1795 security deposit and $1795 a month. You lost no rent money, the placed was cleaned, so no cleaning to do?? Money hungry is the correct term and for you to tell me how much you appreciate our service is a slap in the face that you can just keep.

I do regret your experience thus far. Unfortunately we cannot address maintenance issues that you report directly to the property owner. We always ask that your maintenance requests come directly to us so we can address them promptly. Otherwise we cannot sufficiently help rectify them. There are costs to breaking the lease, which we communicate via the lease and via conversation. While we absolutely appreciate your family's contributions and efforts, the lease must still be abided by.

My sons were looking for a house to rent and came upon one they were interested in. I was asked to tag along, which I did. A scheduled viewing was set and upon arrival, there was someone else there for the same thing. We waited 15 minutes and no one showed up. I called Real Property Management of Midlands and Lashaunda answered and was clueless about if the property was really available. She claimed the prior tenents may still be occupying the property. There was no lockbox, the property was not ready to view, even though it was supposed to be available for rent. The professionalism is not there. I hate my time being wasted and clearly that was a waste. (Broken window, raised grass, looks like it needs an exterminator...and that's just from the outside).

We understand your concern. As the Broker in Charge, Daryl does not coordinate maintenance issues. Our maintenance coordinator has been in communication with you regarding your maintenance issues. We are aware of your complaint of mold in the property. However the multiple vendors we dispatched to the home did not find any evidence of mold. We did dispatch a vendor to perform a mold test per your request. We are waiting for the test results now. If you have any questions about any charges against your account, feel free to contact our office to discuss. We aim to be transparent and upfront with any and all charges on your account.

I don't recommend this company for several reasons, you can't talk to anyone because they rarely if ever answer the phones, you cannot see anyone because they are rarely there. I have a problem with a snake getting in the garage, it took a month before they sent someone out then they didn't repair the problem... maybe that's on the owner but my point is I have never had property managers that were this difficult to see or talk to. And no I don't recommend this company! It is as if it's a bother to deal with you in person!

I am extremely disappointed in this company. Positives: -extremely responsive to be able to tour a house we loved -quickly responded when we expressed interest in applying -ensured us that nobody else had applied, so we went ahead and applied for the house we loved with a $150 total application fee (3 persons) Negatives: After applying for the house, we then received an email stating that the property was no longer available. We were assured that we were the only ones that had applied and apparently in the time between us talking to them on the phone and applying (less than 12 hours) someone else had applied and been approved for the house. We had no idea and are now not able to receive our $50 each deposit back. Had we known somebody else had already applied we would not have applied and risked it. I understand the reason for non-refundable deposits; however, I find it extremely coincidental that someone else applied "minutes" before us when it was communicated that nobody else was interested. While this company has wonderful communication, I am disappointed that we as a whole felt very mislead as a result of our experience with RPM.

I understand your concern. Daryl with Real Property Management Midlands did speak with a young lady about applying for the property in question. However by the time he spoke with her on Tuesday, she and her co-applicant had already applied on Monday. There was a third applicant who had not applied yet, and he informed her that the 3rd applicant would have to apply as well. He did disclose via phone that the home received a lot of attention and that there were multiple applications. We also disclose in writing prior to any applicant completing the application that there may be multiple applications on a given property. Although your application fee is non-refundable, it will still be processed and if approved we can transfer it to another one of our available rentals. You can view our available rentals at www.rpmMidlands.com/houses-rent.

I have been trying to see a house for the past two weeks and all I get is rescheduling emails. I even tried emailing directly to know when would be a good time but no answer. I've learned in my life that if you get this much trouble before you do something it'll only be worse when you finally get in. Ridiculous!!!

I do regret the experience you've had thus far. Unfortunately the last home you tried to view was rented prior to your scheduled showing.

As an Active Duty servicemember, I have never received service like this in 12 years. I do not recommend conducting business with Real Property Management Midlands. Please listen carefully before disregarding this message. I am completely disappointed and upset with the service from Daryl Campbell and Denae Pearson specifically. In March 2020, I filed an application for a home. I was approved and sent a deposit over $2,000 Dollars. In May 2020, 30 Days from moving in, I receive a call from Daryl Campbell that the house I paid the deposit for has been rented out. No apology for the error or attempt to fix the issue until he saw that I was upset about the inconvenience. He offered a refund of my deposit as if that were going to change that I do not have a home to move into. My family is distraught as we look for a home within 30 days! Please do not trust that your money is safe with RPM Midlands. They may contact you and inform you that your deposit does not reserve your place.

I recently chose Real Property Management Midlands to manage my property in Columbia as I currently live in Charlotte, NC. My experience thus far has been nothing short of amazing with this company. I went into business with them and not even a week later they already secured a renter for the property, gave me a detailed checklist on everything needed to maximize my investment, and make me consistently feel at ease knowing that the property is well taken care of. They respond promptly to my questions via email/phone call. If you do not know much about managing a property or want to make sure everything is done right, this is the company to choose! THANK YOU SO MUCH for all you have done to make this transition smooth for me!

IF I COULD GIVE NEGATIVE STARS I WOULD From the start everything seemed OK. I scheduled a viewing and saw the property. The agent didn't seem to knowledgeable but regardless it was what we were looking for so we applied. Within a couple days we got approved! After the weekend passed by I contacted them to schedule my appointment to pay deposit and go through the formality aspect. Well a week went by I heard nothing. I had the agents personal phone number and had called and texted not only her but the office. I left multiple voicemails and texts. Nothing. Finally 2 weeks from the date we got approved I called and got ahold of her. Only to be told that the owners have decided to remove their house. Now I understand this isn't the property managements fault but where is the decency in the fact that I have let two weeks go thinking we have a house and now me and my family will most likely be stuck without something if we don't get lucky. NEVER rent from these people if you want things done professionally

We have been renting with RPM for about 4/5 years. It has been a pleasure. A couple of years ago we had a rough year. Daryl worked with us through this situation and he was extremely patient and understanding. I am thankful for this because he didn't have to be. They also worked with us to keep the same rate over all these years. I think that says a lot. Jeff is always super friendly and upbeat when I call and need anything. He's such a darling. I would continue to rent with them.

These people are horrible, I have moved from being under them April 1st, 2019 due to the owner of the home putting the home up for sale. I gave my 30 day notice and they still charged me for May rent, saying as long as I held the key they can charge rent. However, the 30 day notice given to them was from April 5th to May 5th and the key to the property was turned in May 2nd(before the 30 day notice was up).Now, I receive a letter saying I have a balance for May rent and if not paid they are reporting the balance to the credit bureau even though I was gone since April 1st, 2019. They claim I never gave a 30 day notice even though I did and thank goodness I was smart enough to record when I went to drop it off and when turning the key in at a reasonable amount of time. Now, I'm at a stage if they don't fix it then I'm taking it to the next level. STAY AWAY!!!

I understand your concern. We did not charge rent for the entire month of May. We only charged rent for the days in May that you still had the keys to the home. Feel free to contact our office if you have any other questions or concerns.

Before applying to a home listed on their site I called and asked if anyone had paid a security deposit for it and also made sure there weren't any pending applications. I was assured that my family and I were the first to apply so I applied and waited..and waited...and waited..for a phone call or email for the decision. After the second week, I called Friday and before even getting out my question to the receptionist I was abruptly told to hang on while she transferred me to Tierra's voicemail. I left my voicemail a little before 3p and expected to receive a phone call back since they didn't close til 5p but I never did. Monday morning my fianc√© physically drove there around 1p to find out the status since no one ever called back. We were informed that we were approved but that another family's "rental references" were received before ours so they got the house. My fianc√© asked if I was told or if anyone called to let us know that they needed that from our current property management company bc if they did we would have made sure they got it that day. He was told no that no one reached out and they apologized for never calling us back. DO NOT APPLY THROUGH THIS COMPANY. I am pretty sure they just collect application fees for properties that aren't ready for "move in" or they hold properties for whomever they feel like it. EITHER WAY ITS A SCAM.

I understand your concern. The application process does take 5-10 business days to render a decision. We do aim to return voicemails within 1 business day. We do receive applications for various properties daily. Unfortunately even an approved application does not guarantee occupancy when there are multiple applicants. However, we can transfer your approved application to a different available property.

I'm a retired US Army Veteran I've used Real Property Management and I've had Absolutely no problem with their service at all. Active duty and retired military are very detailed about any decisions we make especially when it comes to being Professional and taking care of our business. I truly think that some of the negative views posted about Real Property was due to lack of communication, asking questions and doing research on concerning this company all this falls on the customer responsibilities. As a former Soldier in order for me to Trust any company with my time money and my business I take my time and do my own research about any company I hire before I give them my business because I never want to experience the unprofessional service of a business after I've paid them my monies for their services. In my research I found someone who's been with Real Property Management for well over 8or 9 years and this person is active duty Senior Noncommissioned Officer in the US Army and they're extremely happy with the service of Real Property Management. I was also neighbors with this client of Real Property Management so after so much research about Real Property Management and finding them to be a credible Professional company I decided to hire Real Property Management and it has been the Very Best Research and Decision I've ever made again all the negative post concerning Real Property Management is due to some customers don't communicate in a timely professional manner to resolve the issues or some just don't realize that Real Property Management works for the owners of these rental homes and if the owner of the home state they want their tenants out it's never personal it's business as a former Soldier and not retired Veteran I would recommend Real Property Management to any and everyone because they do remind me of Squared Away True Professionals Soldiers Special thanks to Daryl words cannot explain how much I appreciate you for knowing and doing your job Also special thanks to the entire Real Property Management team you guys are Outstanding Professionals stay encouraged and keep maintaining your Professionalism regardless of your views God has this company covered Thanks again and God bless you all keep up the Outstanding job Sincerely Melodie Retired, US Army

I just moved into a home that they are in charge of renting and OMG where do I begin!? We just moved in Friday! First of all we couldn't get our key til 12 noon so by the time we started moving in good, it was after business hours. Upon the move in we noticed that the property HAD NOT BEEN cleaned at all. Not even a little bit. Urine around the base of the toilet and on the walls beside them. Also the paint on the walls in the hall upstairs and in the bathroom have fingerprints all over them. Blinds caked up with dust. Food spatter on the blinds in the kitchen. Dirty children's underwear found in the laundry room and the grass is literally almost knee high. They could've at least cut it for our move in. The lock box is still on the doorknob as if the house is still vacant. These people have collected almost 4,000 from my family and I to move in this house and my experience hasn't been welcoming at all. I almost want to punch myself in the gut for not doing my research on this horrible company. I sent several emails out because that's my only way to contact anyone after hours and nobody has reached out to apologize or to tell me that they would fix the problem. Nobody has been sensitive to the fact that my family has moved into a new home and had to clean bodily fluids from previous tenants with our personal supplies. It's not fair! Upon our move in, that house should've been in PRESTINE condition for the money we're paying but instead they took our money, and gave us the keys to a big, dirty, filthy, raunchy house. I am so upset and on the brink of tears! I will NEVER recommend this company and I definitely won't be signing another lease with them. To say they are slumlords would be an understatement!

This has to be by far the worst property management company in the business. They took an app from my aunt and mother on a property that wasn't viewed a month and a half before the property was to become available. When they found another home the broker in charge refused to give their security deposit saying that it was non refundable. To make matters worse the property is still 3 weeks from being move in ready, and if my research is serving me correctly this broker is operating on a suspended license.

We regret that you haven't had an enjoyable experience. Unfortunately the deposit paid to hold the rental is non-refundable if the applicant chooses not to move into the property. We do disclose this multiple times prior to receiving the deposit. We are not operating under any sort of suspended license. Real Property Management Midlands is in good standing.

In my opinion, do not rent from this company. They acquired my property from my previous landlord and tried to charge us another security deposit. Since we were unaware of this, they told us they would break it into payments and cancel the eviction if we did this it that. They never did and filed an eviction because I only paid the rent. We went to court and the judge proved that they could not charge us again for the deposit yet they are trying to take possession of the property and continue the eviction. All of this has happened due to their incompetence and lack of knowledge in what they are doing. Now, I'm having to move out of my home because they refuse to accept their fault in the situation and they refuse to take further payment (the judge can not force them to.) Save yourself the heartache and trouble. I'm devastated they're basically forcing us out our home due to their own errors

I've been with RPM Midlands since 2010 and have had a great experience with them. The team is responsive and keeps you updated on what's going on with your property.

I am now leasing from this company. Love collecting rent money but never like fixing things I have a fungus growing behind the wall in my restroom , I myself use Clorox daily it's so bad that it is Shifting the tile on the wall. The staff is very unprofessional they sent out maintenance vendors that don't know what they doing, bring other people into your home that's not working along with the vendor in your home. I know other people who have rent from this company and stated they are bad business also. I am looking forward into to moving. Please don't rent from them. Make sure they not charging you for extra things I had a problem with that also.

They have fees for everything. To make a payment online will cost you $29 plus the amount you owe. Property has mold in it and toilet was broke 1st day moved in. Please find a company that is reliable and can stand by their name. Also the OWNER, Daryl Campbell himself... That the property is rented as is. Please do not expect cleanliness, or anything close to it. If I could say anything nice...it would be take your your money to a place that doesn't rent AS IS. NOTE: AS IS....IS ONLY FOR BUYING. READ THE CONTRACT! Per conversation with OWNER: THE PROPERTY IS RENTED AS IS.

So my air was broken for over a month. Paid June and July rent regardless. August I refused to pay them because enough was enough. Finally got it repaired on the 12th of September. Upon the repairs being completed, i paid August and September rent. They refused to remove the late fees and the writ fee from August, even thought this just files the eviction on September 7th. So unprofessional. The office has been closed for over a month, apparently they are slow to repair that as well. Awful bunch of unprofessional people. Luckily. I printed up all responses and requests. They are not above the law. IF YOU SEE THEM AS THE PROPERTY MANAGERS RUN, RUN, DON'T WALK AWAY. NOT WORTH IT.

Haven't had the chance to work with this company. I was interested in a home they had listed. Got to the home and followed instructions to view the home, got the lock box open and there was no key to get into the home. I have been calling the office for 2 days and still haven't gotten an answer. Thank God the cost to view was only .99. But if this is how business is conducted now.....I'd hate be a tenant!!!

While I haven't directly dealt with this company, I did intend on viewing a property they are listing as a rental unit. Upon arriving to the property, we decided to not even attempt to go in. First of all, the "parking" area was only accessible through a 4ft crater in the middle of the asphalt. It literally looked like it was a sinkhole. One of the windows was boarded up, which was not shown in pictures, the building was in complete disrepair, and the area itself was nearly abandoned. I'm not sure how it could be legal to rent such a property.

If you are looking for a place to rent do not use this company. Its a good thing I was robbed of my phone down the street from where i stayed at 721 Vernon st Columbia SC 29203 because I would be sending them to court for stealing my deposit. We had to go in and clean the house, buy a smoke detector, patch up holes in the walls, and buy our own refrigerator. We were charged for the broken blinds that they put up to the windows before we moved in. Apparently there were kids living there before us because there was pencil markings in the living room and bedroom next to the kitchen for which we were also charged for. I was nice enough to repaint majority of the home before moving out and was charged for that. The windows didn't open completely which the company was informed and didn't do anything about it. I had to deal with an inefficient hvac system that if I turn the heat or a/c on it would take literally four hours to move up or down 3 degrees. I had to get a space heater and be stuck in my room for two winters if I didn't want a $200+ light bill. There is a leak in the master room ceiling that never got fixed. Due to their lack of keep up the water heater (which is located under the house) burst open causing my water and light bill to skyrocket and I was informed that I would not be reimburse the different from my average cost. Had to go without hot water for 11 days and could not use the toilet as well. These people are only in for the best interest of the owners and even the owner is now trying to sell the home to get from them as well. I have more negative experiences but what I have stated sure be enough for you to look else where.

Worst experience EVER trying to rent a property with them. For 3 weeks we kept getting the run around about a property we wanted to view. Was told to submit application and that we would get a call back within the week about viewing the property (this was after various phone calls). Called back a week after submitting the app and not hearing back, apparently if you just SHOW UP and make a random deposit they will just give you the property and screw those people that came before you that paid for an application previously. I was told by the receptionist that it happens often and that theres no refund for the application. I will continue to let EVERYONE I know in Columbia what a horrific company this is.

Worst rental experience ever! When we moved in the carpet was damaged and stained. It was supposed to be replaced, never got done. Our fridge door was broken and it took them a month to replace. Dishwasher did not drain and had standing water for 3 months before it was replaced. Our hot water heater went out and we were without for almost a week. I do not recommend renting from this company. I don't expect my deposit back although there was clearly no damage done other than minor wear and tear.

One ecstatic customer! Found and moved in after viewing videos online of houses that were up for rent. Having the video footage was good for when we moved out, too. When we had to move because of flooding, the company quickly found us another house and helped us move. The online payment options are great as I do almost everything online. Moving out was no problem, either. We kept good records and so did they. We received our entire deposit back. Recommend using this company whether you own or rent.

So I have to say that this is the worst property management company. If you own property DO NOT let them manage it. Your tenants will NOT be happy. The work will get done and done well but you will jump through hurdles and obstacles to get it done. Essentially you as the tenant will end up doing job of the property management company EVERY single time. The service companies they use know they are on a contract and don't really care when they get out to get things done. I simply wouldn't recommend them.

They honestly don't deserve 1-star... They are true slum lords who lure you into signing a lease without making necessary repairs. They lie and don't keep their word when they make a commitment. I had to put lights and water in my name so they could make so called repairs before moving in. Repairs that never got fixed. They aviod your calls and don't take responsibility for their errors. Im still without a place to stay and out of 1200 dollars. Worst company EVER!!

Two weeks went by with no phone calls telling me if I was approved or declined. I kept calling and leaving voicemails no one every called me back.

This is the worst property management company that I've ever dealt with in my life. They only care about collecting the rent and charging outrageous fees. They don't accept any responsibility when it comes to fixing issues wrong with unit. They try to place blame and charge tenant for repairs they knew pre-existed in unit. They don't assume any responsibility, by blaming landlord for hold up on repairs; when the lease you sign states real property management. They lack professionalism, customer service, and empathy. You have to keep contacting them to resolve your issue, and every time you call they put you hold for long periods of time. It's almost as if you work harder than them to get anything resolved. You never get a straight forward answer. I lived in their unit for one year; and 6 out of the 12 months, my family lived without the proper flooring. I was intimidated into paying full months rent by being threatened to be evicted; even though the unit was drastically different from when I signed my lease due to a sewage backup. Within the first 6 months, I've had over 7 major work orders. I'm sure if more of their customers were knowledgeable about this option, they would have a lot more negative reviews and complaints. Stir clear of this company, I was told personally that their loyalty is to the landlord not the tenant.

Worst renting experience I have ever endured. Was forced to hire an attorney and break the lease early because of there refusal to adhere to fair housing rules and regulations. The home was marketed as having heat and air, and even told by management that the home had both. Only to find out upon moving in that the home had neither air nor heat. They refused to make any necessary repairs needed in the home: ‚Ä¢Damaged roof that leaked when it rained. ‚Ä¢Raccoons that made there way into the attic from a hole in the roof. ‚Ä¢electrical issues that would cause the fuse box to constantly trip. Electrical outlets would spark and smoke. ‚Ä¢zero insulation in the home causing energy bills to be extremely high. Had the home audited by SCE&G they concluded major housing code violations. ‚Ä¢Trash left around the adjacent unit from the previous tenants. 8 months after they moved out. ‚Ä¢rude customer service from the entire staff. Would get into arguments with the staff for with holding rent payment for poor living conditions of the unit. ‚Ä¢had to stay in a hotel when conditions got too poor to live in.

Definitely not for us. When we first contacted the representative to tour the home, she showed up 1.5 hrs late, was rude to the neighbor who let her in & called back to let us know she took a look at our home in Indianapolis (where we currently live; the investment property is in the Midlands...obviously?) & wanted to talk about signing a contract. Tried to contact the agency again several months later only to be assigned the same representative. This time, she was very rude to me and extremely daft. I exchanged several emails entailing exactly what I was looking for & a date we would be down in the Midlands to update the deck on the property. She responded with a very nasty toned email, accusing me of giving her different information. I don't understand how she could become so easily confused, but I definitely will not leave this individual (or company) in charge of my investment.

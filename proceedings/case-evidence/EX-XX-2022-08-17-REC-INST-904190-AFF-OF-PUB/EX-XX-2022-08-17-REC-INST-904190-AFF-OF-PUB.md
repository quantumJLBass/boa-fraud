### how it pertains to the case

Using the public "Notice of Default," a seasoned bidder determines the likely minimum bid as follows:

1. **Principal Balance** (provided in the notice): **$139,529.94**  

2. **Accrued Interest** (calculated at 4.375% per annum):  
   - Daily Rate: \( 4.375\% \div 365 = 0.011986\% \)  
   - Days Accrued (from **August 1, 2022**, to **December 12, 2023**): **498 days**  
   - Accrued Interest = \( 139,529.94 \times 0.00011986 \times 498 = 8,328.79 \)  

3. **Estimated Fees and Costs**:  
   Based on typical trustee sale expenses, fees accrue monthly and are estimated as follows:  
   - **Monthly Estimate for Fees**: \( \textbf{\$500 - \$1,000} \)  
   - **Total Duration**: From **August 1, 2022**, to **December 12, 2023** (16.5 months).  

   Therefore:  
   - **Low-End Fees**: \( 500 \times 16.5 = \textsf{\$8,250} \) (rounded to \$10,000 for contingencies)  
   - **High-End Fees**: \( 1,000 \times 16.5 = \textsf{\$16,500} \) (rounded to \$15,000 for balance).  

   Realistic range for fees and costs: **$10,000 - $15,000**.

4. **Total Likely Minimum Bid**:  
   Combining principal, interest, and estimated fees:  

   - **Low Estimate**:  
     \[
        139,529.94 + 8,328.79 + 10,000 = ~\textcolor{red}{\$157,858.73}
     \]
   - **High Estimate**:  
     \[
        139,529.94 + 8,328.79 + 15,000 = ~\textcolor{red}{\$162,858.73}
     \]

### Why Private Trustee Contact Is Improper and Unnecessary:

1. **Unnecessary**:  
   - With the publicly available **principal balance**, **interest rate**, and reasonable estimates for fees and costs, any experienced bidder can calculate a likely minimum bid accurately.  

2. **Per-Month Fee Estimation**:  
   - A standard fee accrual of **$500 - $1,000 per month** covers typical trustee fees, legal costs, unpaid taxes, and other advances.  
   - Given the 16.5 months since the default date, the total fees align with the above **$10,000 - $15,000 range**.  

3. **Unfair Advantage**:  
   - Private communication providing precise figures undermines fair competition and public trust.  
   - It gives one bidder access to privileged information, disadvantaging others.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - Using **only the Notice of Default** and standard fee estimates, a seasoned bidder calculates a likely minimum bid of **$157,858.73 to $162,858.73**.  
   - This demonstrates that private pre-auction conversations are both **unnecessary** and **inequitable**.

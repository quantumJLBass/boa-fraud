Another LQBTQ family that can discredit any discrimination this company was accused of having.  We had a wonderful,  smooth process moving in. We love our home! Awesome communication throughout the entire moving process. Would highly recommend this company!

Disappointing Discrimination

Review:
My wife and I recently had an extremely disheartening experience with Providence Management. We were excited about the possibility of renting a home through them, as we had heard positive things about their services. However, our excitement quickly turned into disappointment when we were denied solely because of our sexual orientation.

We provided all the necessary documents and met all the requirements they asked for. It is deeply saddening to encounter such blatant discrimination in this day and age.

Discrimination based on sexual orientation is not only morally wrong but also illegal in many places. It is important for businesses to uphold principles of equality and inclusivity, treating all individuals with respect and fairness. Providence Management failed to do so, tarnishing their reputation in our eyes.

We strongly encourage the company to reevaluate their policies and practices to ensure that no one else has to endure the same discrimination that we experienced. Discrimination has no place in our society, and it is our hope that this review serves as a reminder for them to promote inclusivity and equality for all.

We were able to find the property owner and are reaching out to him with our concerns.

Jog, run, SPRINT and GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!!
If you are of any minority or LGBTQ don't even waist your time with this company. The moment my wife said "my partner", everything changed.  They are extremely discriminating and will not accept you even if you provide ALL required information and more. We even offered above asking rental price and to put more money down on the deposit. Tammy was extremely unprofessional when speaking to us. We were told none of our documents provided would be accepted because we are household staff and don't have "real jobs". She even hung up on us and avoided our calls. This entire office is unprofessional, hateful, and discriminatory.

Details are incoming but believe the previous reviews from 1yr+ ago. Nothing has changed so if your Afro-American, don't waste your time, gas or $$ going to their office because we are not wanted as tenants with them and their so called home owners.

This has been a great experience from a homeowner's perspective.   The house was rented in about a month and Leighton kept me in the loop throughout the entire process. I would recommend Providence Management to anyone looking to place a tenant into their property.

BEWARE OF RENTAL SCAM. I recently applied for a rental home from Providence Property Management. The home had been on the market for a little over a month, which I thought seemed odd because it was in a highly desirable neighborhood for a pretty fair price. After starting the ridiculously intense application process, I quickly understood why the house had been on the market for so long. Not only does this company charge insanely high non-refundable application fees ($75 cash per applicant so $150 total for both my boyfriend and I) but they also ask for a money order (seems sketchy) of the first months rent for them to prioritize your application. Even if you apply first (but don't hand over the money order), if another applicant drops off their application the next day with their money order, your application will be set aside and not processed. PLUS, you have to drop off all application materials in person at their office in Gastonia.

They also required me to give notice to my current apartment, despite not even being approved for the rental home.

After two weeks of a ridiculous amount of effort and money applying to this rental property, I was denied. Myself and my boyfriend met all the income requirements, we made around 5x the amount of the rent, we have no history of eviction or rental issues, and we both have great high paying jobs. I was denied because my boyfriend had not given notice to his apartment complex that he was leaving. I don't understand how that could possibly be a requirement to get approved, when you literally put your current living situation at stake just in the hopes that you will be approved.

I of course did not get my $150 application fee back. The employees working at this company are disgustingly rude, dismissive, and have no regard for any of their clients/ applicants.

I just checked, the rental house is STILL on the market and it's been two months. I wonder how many other applicants have coughed up $150 and been denied...? It seems to be a great stream of income for this company if they continue to accept applications, deny them, and pocket the money.

The staff is the antithesis of helpful, specifically Leighton Harris. Email exchanges were curt, brief and it was IMPOSSIBLE to get simple, straightforward answers. The property itself was in great condition and while I would have loved to have lived there, dealing with this management group is ultimately the reasoning for this one-star review.

I am moving to the Charlotte area for my job and currently live two hours away. I called Providence Management to find out if it was possible to submit an application online or through the mail and to see if a particular property allowed dogs. The lady told me that you had to come in person to submit an application and to include a picture of my dog with it, saying that "he" (the owner I assume?) would decide. I drove down to their office only to be told by the lady there that they couldn't accept my application because pets aren't allowed at that property. So because they require people to submit their application in person and don't provide any alternative methods for people moving from out of town, and because of either their lack of knowledge or communication, I spent half the day (and a good amount of gas) to drive there and back - all to be told something that it would be reasonable to expect a professional rental company to tell you over the phone when you ask.

Was approved with another company for a 1200 townhome but I turned it down cause I just knew I'd be approved for providence managements townhome on Avalon in Lowell. Which were only 1195 a month.
Nope denied even though I'm currently paying 1695 a month where I'm at.
And when you get denied they tell you to come up to the office as they can't tell you over the phone only to get to the office and they hand you a paper and say call them they will explain why. THEN CALL THE company to call only to be told they will have too mail you out a paper explaining why!!!!! Soooooooooo soooo ridiculous I do NOT recommend. Horrible experience $300 down the drain in application fees because I passed up the home I was actually approved for for these because I had just been approved with another company. Sad.

Homeowners wanting to rent their property beware!
Long story short, if they treat the homeowners unprofessionally and disrespectfully, how would they treat our tenants?  I rarely write negative reviews but their disrespect for my time and poor and ignored communication was my tipping point.  There is no way I could entrust these people to take care of both my property and my tenants the way they deserve to be treated, especially living on the other side of the country in CA.  Read on if you're a property owner looking for a rental company.....

Staff is young and inexperienced.  Chelsea couldn't answer any simple questions without running to her manager and I was still given incorrect information.  I was told I wouldn't be charged a 10% project fee for painting my house to make it "rent ready" only to find after I flew into Charlotte from CA and back that they were going to charge me.  Was also told they have all the resources for any type of house project although she had no clue when I asked her about finding a siding contractor and masonry contractor one week later.
Wasted two weeks of house preparation time and a round trip waiting to get answers to my questions.

When I asked to speak to her manager Deanna (?) she refused to call me back unless I conveyed the issue through Chelsea.  After several requests to speak to Deanna directly, she finally graces me with a phone call and after the first minute of discussing my concern about Chelsea I realize I'm on speaker phone and Chelsea is in the room with her!  Cute...very professional; you never put your client on a speaker phone without asking permission and certainly don't have someone in the room with you without divulging it first.

Upon telling Deanna I was firing her company due to misinformation from her employee and unprofessional conduct from herself, the attitude got even worse.  I still haven't received a simple e-mail I requested stating we had broken our agreement nor have they returned any of my e-mails inquiring about receiving the correct house keys back.  Apparently, they don't handle complaints very well either.

Me and my girlfriend put in an application for an apartment with them which is a 50$ fee each. We were the first applicants and they told us to wait on the deposit because there were no other applicants and that they would call us if approved. Got a call this morning about signing the lease tmr. I call again later at 4:30pm and they say that someone came by this morning and put an application in and a deposit and they get the house instantly. There's no way a background check was ran that fast, and it was very unprofessional to call and let us know we got approved just to disappoint us later on in the day.  100$ completely scammed from us. I have 5x the rent and deposit I was willing to put down. Don't work with these people. They tell you one thing and then another.

DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY! They are so slow to fix anything and quick to add a late fee or increase in already overpriced rental agreements for dilapidated and outdated  houses that they just slapped fresh paint on. IT IS NOT WORTH THE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE OR HEADACHE. And then if you wanna file a grievance, save your breath. The woman who answers the phone will tell you that they don't have a corporate office and the person you file a grievance with, is the main person causing the grievance! Not to mention they'll take their time and create any excuse and exploit any loophole to not return your deposit.

I have Lived at one of their Properties going on 3 Years. I just now encountered my first issue here, the AC unit was very old and on its last leg (my first maintenance call to this place in the first 3 years) let them know the AC was not performing well. They quickly had one of their vendors out to check out the unit, and a few days later the vendor came with a whole new system had me up and running in not time! Great place to rent!!!! You will not find a better company or better places/prices to rent from around Gaston area.

The lady up front was so nice at first, we explained our credit situation which it just barely met their standards and everything else about our application checked out and was perfect. Oh but no we didn't get the place cause of the credit but yet they said they would accept it. So much for giving us false hope and trying everything you can to get our money. Sucks they are losing out on so much money since they wanna keep the place on market.

I rented a property from this place for a year and had a number of problems with service.

First off, when I rented the property, there was a good deal of cleaning up that had to done.  The oven had what looked to be years of caked on goods.  The refrigerator had not been cleaned.  There were random pieces of wood stakes with nails in them that I found throughout the house.  And a heavy amount of floor tiles were left in a bedroom closet which had to be removed.  On top of that, the leaves from the previous fall had been left on the premises and as I was raking them I found a copperhead hiding under them.

Now, I did not complain about it, I dutifully cleaned it up and respected it as my home.  However, when I had issues with the leaky faucets it was over a month and the bathroom faucet was never fixed.  When I mentioned that the air conditioning did not work properly, I was told that the owner of the property had everything new in the house and it was just a hot summer.  When I asked why the heating system did not work well despite weather proofing doors, windows, and even putting blankets on walls, they were not interested in finding out why. "It was just an old mill house."

The $525 I paid a month in rent plus the $200+ dollars I had to pay in utilities weren't cutting it so I sought another place.  I have pictures to prove that I cleaned the place meticulously and sowed new grass seed in the garden beds that they said I could grow.

What did I receive in return?  Well Josh Fannin never came to officially check me out of the property.  Several weeks after moving out I received my deposit that was nearly cut in half claiming that I had left the place in a mess (I have pictures to prove this was not the case). I did not pursue it further but this shows you the honesty of the leadership here.  I always paid my rent on time and barely came to them with minor issues.

I even tried to give a second chance by looking into another property.  The receptionist was quite rude and although the house seems nice I would rather contact the actual owner than go through this company again.

If you do decide to deal with them, take pictures of and videotape the premises of the rental property before.  Make sure that Josh Fannin views the property with you before departure and explains any issues before moving out.  And last but not least request the contact information for the landlord and report them to the BBB if they shrug off maintenance issues.

If I could give 0 stars I would. They are horrible people. When I started renting my central air did not work. It took them until December to fix it for me. I had to sleep in my living room to get any sort of heat. Their repair person came into my house while I was at work rummaged through my personal items and stole from me. I then in January needed my door knob fixed and was never contacted back until February and at that point I had to fix the door myself. There is a terrible bee problem that has been lingering since I moved in last October and I was recently laid off my job and was unable to pay rent for 2 weeks. They are now taking me to court for $24.75 and is trying to illegally charge me $126 court cost, $24.75 for complaint filing fee, $50 court appearance fee (Per NC state law they can not charge me this unless I loose the case and we actually go to court) The lady Marri or Marry is a very sour woman. And they charged my ex $75 for moving out of the home.

This leasing company is HORRIBLE!!! The lady at the office with the black Dora the explore looking haircut is SOOOOO RUDE! Me and my husband did a walk through BY OURSELVES (which should never happen) now I know to always make sure the owner is present... well anyway we did a walk through and wrote down everything wrong with the house.. the walls were the main thing we wrote down because they were never painted prior to us moving moving in. My son was never able to take baths because there was no stopper for the tub. We got charged
For that too.. how can you charge someone when you have it on paper from your walk through? This company will rip you off. It's a reason why they're 3 stars.

Over-priced slum housing. The property management sweet talks you until you sign your lease and then you are at their mercy. They look out solely for themselves and the homeowners who rent out the damaged and houses that could never be sold unless they were repaired extensively, and their repairs are typically caulking/cheap paint. You WILL be ripped off by this company if you use them, so run if you can help it.

Absolutley unprofessional, the receptionist was misleading over the phone and rude in person. The website looks to be designed by a group of toddlers. When speaking to them about homes they were disorganized with information about which homes had deposits and which didn't. Matt couldn't take 30 seconds out of his Doritos excursion to answer my questions without spewing saliva and Doritos crumbs all over the counter. Extremely unprofessional, will never rent from them.

Great group of professionals! I love working with the agents from PMI. They are always client minded and want to do what's best for them. Anytime one of my clients is buying new construction and using an agent from this firm I reiterate what a great decision they have made and are in great hands!

even if the bidders, i.e., the plaintiffs, didn't know they were committing fraud, they still did. it's a **Constructive fraud. that fraud should make the sale void from the start**

-------------------------------------------------------------

The massive thing is that the "bidder" said they had called the trustees to work out details to find out if they were going to bid.

-------------------------------------------------------------

While at the auction, the video will show that there was no one else who showed up and that Mr. Bass had done nothing that would have scared off anyone because there was no one else to scare off. The video shows that the auctioneer and the bidder talked, both split and got on the phone, came back together, played with some papers, then got on the phone again, and then tried to get the sheriff to arrest Mr. Bass, which they didn't.

-------------------------------------------------------------

There was only the bidder, Debbie Lawrence, the auctioneer (unknown name), and Mr. Bass, but that is it.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Mr. Bass was prevented from bidding in the auction because if he participated, then it would be doing so while knowing that the auction had been rigged, making the act of bidding while knowing, a criminal act, so Mr. Bass just half a sign to warn anyone and protect any innocent buyer as Mr. Bass has the responsibility to minimize injury when possible, so he held a sign quietly while the two played with the printed checks.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Glenda Morlan is not directly tied to the plaintiffs, just another local developer that was competing with the plaintiff's.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Mr. Bass is having $144000 in equity stolen through these happenings and would lose nearly $300k in the short term, but injuryed by millions over the next few years both in the credit damage and the loss of everything.

-------------------------------------------------------------

**Constructive fraud** occurs when a breach of a legal or equitable duty results in an advantage to one party at the expense of another, even without intent to deceive. In the context of Mr. Bass's case, constructive fraud could apply to the foreclosure process and related transactions if procedural defects, misrepresentation, or a failure to disclose material information created a situation that unjustly disadvantaged him while benefiting the Plaintiffs, trustees, or servicers.

### Key Elements of Constructive Fraud in This Context:

1. **Breach of Duty**:

- Trustees and servicers have a fiduciary duty to act impartially and fairly in a foreclosure sale. Allowing collusion, failing to provide proper notices, or mishandling trustee appointments breaches these duties.
- Example: If Carrington Mortgage Services or the trustee facilitated collusion in the auction process, they breached their duty to ensure a fair and open sale.

1. **Reliance on Misrepresentation**:

- Constructive fraud may arise if documents (e.g., backdated promissory notes, loan modifications) contain material inaccuracies or omitted key details, leading Bass to rely on false assumptions.
- Example: Providing backdated loan documents and subordinate notes falsely implied a legal basis for foreclosure under invalid instruments.

1. **Unjust Enrichment**:

- If the Plaintiffs benefited from defects in the foreclosure process (e.g., rigged auction, invalid notices, or defective instruments), constructive fraud could be claimed.
- Example: Plaintiffs gaining title through a flawed auction despite knowledge of the irregularities.

1. **Absence of Intent**:

- Unlike actual fraud, constructive fraud does not require malicious intent. Instead, it focuses on the unfair advantage gained through wrongful acts or omissions.

### Application in Mr. Bass's Case:

1. **Procedural Defects**:

- Failure to follow statutory foreclosure requirements, such as proper notice of sale or use of valid instruments, could support claims of constructive fraud.

1. **Break in Title Chain**:

- The title chain's integrity is critical. Backdating documents or failing to record modifications properly may have created confusion and led to a flawed foreclosure.

1. **Collusion at Auction**:

- If evidence shows Plaintiffs prearranged bids or coordinated with trustees, this violates the principles of a fair sale and constitutes constructive fraud.

1. **Excessive Forbearance**:

- Extending forbearance beyond statutory limits and coercing Bass into modifications with additional fees could also reflect constructive fraud, as it unfairly extended Bass's financial liability.

### Legal Implications:

Constructive fraud undermines the validity of the foreclosure sale, auction results, and subsequent title transfers. Demonstrating it may void the sale and force the court to scrutinize the trustee's actions, auction integrity, and Plaintiffs' claims of bona fide purchaser status.

### Strategy:

- **Focus on procedural defects** (e.g., notices, invalid instruments) to establish breaches of duty.
- Highlight **unjust enrichment** and unfair advantages gained by Plaintiffs or trustees.
- Present **evidence of collusion** and backdated documents to reinforce claims of constructive fraud.
- Argue the cumulative effect of defects creates inequity requiring judicial intervention.

### Ways the Auction Could Be Proven Void Ab Initio (From the Start)

Here is a comprehensive analysis of how the foreclosure auction could be proven void ab initio, based on procedural, substantive, and legal grounds raised by Defendant Jeremy Bass:

### 1. **Wrong Instrument Foreclosed On**

- **Evidence**:
- Defendant asserts that the foreclosure was initiated on an incorrect Deed of Trust. The 2009 Letter of Full Reconveyance (Instrument No. 775252) extinguished the original Deed of Trust​(defendant-2024-11-24)​(Response to MSJ).
- Evidence includes conflicting loan terms between the instrument used for foreclosure and backdated loan documents submitted by the bank​(Response to MSJ).
- **Legal Basis**:
- Under Idaho Code § 45-1508, foreclosures based on defective or incorrect instruments are void, as no legal debt can be enforced under an invalid instrument​(MOTION FOR RECONSIDERAT…).

### 2. **Collusion and Auction Rigging**

- **Evidence**:
- Plaintiffs' admissions in the Second Declaration of DPW Enterprises LLC confirm pre-auction communication with the trustee, violating Idaho's Trust Deeds Act​(DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE TO…)​(Declaration of DPW Ente…).
- Video evidence and chat logs show collusive behavior, including prearranged bids and pre-printed checks matching exact amounts​(AFFIDAVIT OF JEREMY L. …)​(Response to MSJ).
- Emails sent by Defendant Bass warned the trustee of ongoing violations before the auction​(DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE TO…)​(AFFIDAVIT OF JEREMY L. …).
- **Legal Basis**:
- Idaho Code § 45-1506 requires auctions to be fair and open. Collusion invalidates the competitive nature required in public auctions​(Response to MSJ).
- Sherman Antitrust Act (15 U.S.C. § 1) prohibits bid rigging, which constitutes a felony. Such violations void the sale entirely​(DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE TO…).

### 3. **Lack of a Valid Default**

- **Evidence**:
- Defendant claims to have entered into a verbal agreement with the mortgage servicer to cure the default, supported by payments for taxes and insurance normally handled by escrow​(Response to MSJ)​(AFFIDAVIT OF JEREMY L. …).
- Lack of proper default notice, as required under Idaho Code § 45-1506, further invalidates the foreclosure​(DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE TO…)​(MOTION FOR RECONSIDERAT…).
- **Legal Basis**:
- Baker v. Nationstar Mortg., LLC clarifies that the absence of a valid default renders a foreclosure sale void ab initio​(MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT O…)​(MOTION FOR RECONSIDERAT…).

### 4. **Procedural Defects in Notice**

- **Evidence**:
- Incomplete and invalid notices to vacate, referencing non-existent attachments, were served​(DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE TO…)​(Response to MSJ).
- Video evidence of the auction demonstrates a lack of required public announcements, violating Idaho Code § 45-1506​(AFFIDAVIT OF JEREMY L. …).
- **Legal Basis**:
- Spencer v. Jameson holds that material defects in statutory notice requirements void the foreclosure sale​(MOTION FOR RECONSIDERAT…)​(MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT O…).

### 5. **Conflict of Interest**

- **Evidence**:
- IDEA Law Group acted as trustee despite conflicts of interest, having close ties with Carrington Mortgage Services​(Response to MSJ).
- Evidence of joint participation in industry events and shared boards raises concerns of impartiality​(Response to MSJ)​(MOTION FOR RECONSIDERAT…).
- **Legal Basis**:
- Trustees must act impartially under Idaho Code § 45-1506. A breach of fiduciary duty voids the sale​(Response to MSJ).

### 6. **Auction on Wrong Date and Terms**

- **Evidence**:
- The auction terms, including prearranged bid amounts and tailored checks, were communicated privately rather than announced at the auction​(Response to MSJ)​(DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE TO…).
- Plaintiffs presented evidence suggesting exact coordination with the trustee regarding bid requirements, violating fair trade principles​(DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE TO…)​(MOTION FOR RECONSIDERAT…).
- **Legal Basis**:
- Breckenridge Prop. Fund 2016, LLC v. Wally Enter. reaffirms that public auctions must operate under announced and equal terms. Any deviation renders the sale invalid​(MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT O…)​(MOTION FOR RECONSIDERAT…).

### 7. **Breach of Tenant Rights**

- **Evidence**:
- Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act (PTFA) requires a minimum 90-day notice for tenants like Pike. No valid notices were served​(AFFIDAVIT OF JEREMY L. …)​(Response to MSJ).
- **Legal Basis**:
- PTFA violations void the eviction process and question the legitimacy of the trustee sale's post-sale proceedings​(DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE TO…).

### Supporting Logic for Void Status

- **Void vs. Voidable**:
- A void sale has no legal effect from the outset, as it violates foundational statutory or contractual requirements.
- A voidable sale remains valid until challenged but can be upheld under certain conditions. Defendant Bass's evidence suggests void conditions.

### Summary

The auction appears void from the start based on:

1. Wrong instrument foreclosed on.
2. Collusion and auction rigging.
3. Lack of valid default.
4. Procedural defects in notice.
5. Trustee conflict of interest.
6. Prearranged terms violating public auction requirements.
7. Breach of tenant rights.

These points, supported by specific evidence and legal standards, demonstrate substantial grounds to invalidate the auction as void ab initio. Let me know if you'd like a structured legal memorandum for further clarity.

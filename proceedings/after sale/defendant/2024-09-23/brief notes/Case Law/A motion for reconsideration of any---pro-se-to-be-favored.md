A motion for reconsideration of any interlocutory orders of the trial court may be made at any time before the entry of final judgment but not later than fourteen (14) days after the entry of the final judgment. A motion for reconsideration of any order of the trial court made after entry of final judgment may be filed within fourteen (14) days from the entry of such order


None of these authorities preclude reconsideration of a trial court's interlocutory decision on the bases of the initial evidence. Indeed, a rule requiring new evidence on a motion for reconsideration would be a cause for concern. It would prevent a party from drawing the trial court's attention to errors of law [***14]  or fact in the initial decision, precluding correction of even flagrant errors except through an appeal.

Accordingly, we hold that the absence of new evidence accompanying Johnson's motion for reconsideration did not, standing alone, require that the motion be denied.

At the same time, "[p]leadings must be construed so as to do justice." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(e). Therefore, a "document filed pro se is to be liberally construed and a pro se complaint, however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers." Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007) (citations omitted). Courts are not to "dismiss a pro se complaint without leave to amend unless 'it is absolutely clear that the deficiencies of the complaint could not be cured by amendment.'" Rosati v. Igbinoso, 791 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir. 2015) (citing Akhtar v. Mesa, 698 F.3d 1202, 1212 (9th Cir. 2012) (quoting Schucker v. Rockwood, 846 F.2d 1202, 1204 (9th Cir.1988) (per curiam))).

Subject: Follow up on contact. Immediate Action Required: Report on Foreclosure Auction Misconduct and Request for Investigation

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to follow up on my previous letter dated March 1, 2024, regarding the wrongful foreclosure auction of my property by Bank of America (BoA), Carrington Mortgage Services (CMS), ReconTrust Company N.A., and their collaborators. It’s not just about the foreclosure as there is mass fraud that was uncovered and touches everything from rampant securities fraud to RICO with rings at local levels of many cities where BoA does business. Despite the gravity of my allegations and the urgent plea for investigative and legal intervention, I am disheartened to report that I have yet to receive a response or acknowledgment from your office or any of the authorities and organizations previously contacted.

**Unaddressed Allegations and New Information**

The silence and inaction to my initial plea have left me in an increasingly precarious situation. In my ongoing struggle against the unjust foreclosure of my home, I have encountered a profound silence from authorities regarding not only my property but also several critical issues that pose grave implications for public safety and justice. These matters, while distinct from the foreclosure debacle, are integral to showcasing the extent of misconduct and malfeasance I am fighting against. My tenant, in a bid to prevent our displacement and contribute to a safer community, has come forward with a willingness to expose key individuals involved in the fentanyl trade. This offer of cooperation, emerging from our shared plight, underscores the severity of the situation and our commitment to justice.

**Fentanyl Trade Exposure:** My tenant is ready to provide names of significant figures in the fentanyl trade, a gesture aimed not only at securing our residence but also at curbing a deadly epidemic. This act of courage and desperation highlights the broader societal impacts of our personal battle.

**Attempt on My Life:** I have recently discovered that there is no statute of limitations on attempts on one's life. This revelation pertains to a previous incident involving a Pinkerton Agent affiliated with an Executive Threat Team for a major corporation. This attack on my life, which I had previously mentioned in passing, now stands as a pivotal issue. I assert my right to press charges and demand a thorough investigation into this heinous act.

**DOJ Agent Misconduct:** In a troubling breach of ethics and legal standards, I have identified a Department of Justice agent who inappropriately intervened in matters directly affecting my fight for justice. This individual's presence in a scenario where their involvement was unwarranted suggests a covert attempt to suppress my efforts. I possess concrete evidence of this misconduct, including the agent's identity and proof of their undue interference.

**Extortion Ring of Doctors:** In a disturbing discovery, my investigations have unearthed an extortion ring involving medical professionals. This network appears to operate nationwide, exploiting patients for financial gain under the guise of healthcare. The implications of such practices are profound, affecting countless innocent lives and undermining the integrity of the medical profession. My commitment to bringing this issue to light is driven by a fundamental belief in the right to safe and honest medical treatment for all.

**Cross-State Sexual Assault Involving a Minor and Methamphetamine:** Another grave issue I've encountered involves a sexual assault on a minor, a case that spans across state lines and is intertwined with the illicit methamphetamine trade/use as I was informed. My resolve to address this issue stems from a deep-seated conviction that justice for victims and stringent action against perpetrators are paramount.

These issues are not merely ancillary; they are critically interwoven with my struggle against the foreclosure of my home. They serve as stark illustrations of the systemic problems that enable and protect fraudulent activities and criminal behaviors. By bringing these matters to light alongside my fight against the foreclosure, I aim to underscore the urgency for comprehensive action and investigation.

The linkage of these grave concerns to my central issue of foreclosure is deliberate. It is a plea for the authorities to recognize the multifaceted nature of the injustice I am confronting. These additional allegations, each serious in their own right, amplify my call for immediate and decisive intervention. My case is not simply about a property dispute; it is a microcosm of larger systemic failures that threaten public trust and safety.

In presenting these issues, my intention is clear: to compel action by making it impossible to ignore the breadth and depth of misconduct at play. This approach is not taken lightly but is born out of necessity, driven by the ongoing refusal of local and higher authorities to engage with the egregious violations of law and decency I have documented. My fight for my home has inadvertently exposed me to a broader struggle against corruption and injustice, one that I am unwillingly but resolutely engaged in.

**A Plea for Justice and Logical Action**

The inaction from local authorities, with both the Lewiston Police Department and the County Sheriff's Office deeming my situation as "civil" and deciding not to follow up, has placed me in an untenable position. I understand that they are busy trying to help others and that they were not seeing the connections on the criminal parts, but if someone had come, talked with me, and listened, I am sure it would have become very clear. It raises a massive question: What am I, a victim of systemic fraud and misconduct, supposed to do? The suggestion that I should quietly allow the theft of my home and simply move on is not only unjust but illogical. If the rigged auction and the subsequent attempt to steal my home are deemed civil matters, then it stands to reason that my continued residence in my home, along with my tenant's, should also be considered a civil matter, protected from forcible eviction without due process.

The lack of action has essentially forced me into a corner where refusing to leave my property appears as the only viable form of resistance against a clearly rigged and illegal process. This stance, however, should not be necessary. The law and justice should serve as the bulwarks against such blatant acts of fraud and corruption.

**Request for Immediate Review and Action**

I implore your office and all relevant authorities to take my plea seriously and act with the urgency this situation demands. The auction of my home must be nullified, and a thorough investigation into all allegations presented must be initiated. It is not just about one property or one individual; it is about upholding the integrity of our legal and financial systems, protecting the rights of citizens, and ensuring that justice prevails over corruption and malfeasance.

The detailed account of violations and misconduct I have provided, along with the additional information my tenant is willing to offer, underscores the need for a multi-faceted investigation that encompasses financial fraud, collusion, and now, significant criminal activity. It is a matter of public interest and safety.

**Conclusion**

I am at a loss for how to proceed in the face of systemic inaction and or disregard for legal rights and ethical standards, be it willful or not. My plea is not only for the sake of my property and personal situation but for the broader implications these actions have on the rule of law and trust in our institutions. I am offering everything I can, risking personal safety and security, in the hope of garnering attention to these matters. All I ask in return is for your office and the relevant authorities to fulfill their duties to investigate, intervene, and ensure justice is served.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. I remain available to provide any further information or documentation required and await your prompt and decisive response.

Sincerely,

Jeremy Lee Bass

Subject: Immediate Action Required: Report on Foreclosure Auction Misconduct and Request for Investigation

To Whom It May Concern,

I am compelled to seek your urgent assistance following the wrongful foreclosure auction of my property on February 29, 2024, despite a prior agreement to suspend proceedings pending the resolution of my mother's estate probate. This letter reports significant misconduct and requests a thorough investigation by your office into the practices of Bank of America (BoA), Carrington Mortgage Services (CMS), ReconTrust Company N.A., and their collaborators that led to this unjust foreclosure.

**Foreclosure Auction Misconduct: A Summary of Events**

The foreclosure auction, previously halted, proceeded under questionable circumstances, leading to the sale of my home for \$165,000—well below its fair market value of \$275,000. This sale was to an individual previously recorded attempting to intimidate me into selling my property at a gross undervalue, more then suggesting collusion with BoA and potential real estate developers, but instead confirming the recorded claim of the local developers working with BoA in fixing the auction. The orchestration of this auction, including the premature lifting of the hold despite an existing agreement, underscores a systematic pattern of fraudulent and unethical behavior by the involved parties.

**Historical and Recent Misconduct**

My dealings with BoA and Carrington have been marred by a history of deceit, legal violations, and unethical practices dating back to 2008. This includes:

- Presentation of backdated documents and attempts at bribery by CMS in December 2021.
- Coercive tactics and misrepresentations in legal proceedings by BoA.
- Financial discrepancies, unjust charges, and attempts at manipulation by BoA and CMS, in clear violation of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), the CARES Act, and the Idaho Consumer Protection Act.
- Unauthorized loan modifications by BoA, directly violating federal laws.
- Imposed unjustified fees, breaching the CARES Act and RESPA guidelines.
- Engaged in systematic obstruction to prevent securing legal representation, impacting the right to a fair defense.
- Conducted a foreclosure auction with a single bidder, indicative of auction rigging and collusion.
- Breached an explicit agreement to postpone the foreclosure auction, violating contract terms.
- The single bidder at the auction was the local developer who attempted to coerce the property sale before the auction.
- Demonstrated a pattern of misleading court representations to obfuscate their actions.
- Failed to conduct an internal audit after discovering erroneous filings, suggesting a disregard for legal compliance.
- BoA was fined \$4 billion for inflating their books, indicating systemic financial manipulation, and over \$100 billion in total so far since 2008 for many of these same actions
- BoA knowingly created and utilized a second deed of trust and promissory note with the intent to deceive.
- CMS offered a bribe for compliance, which constitutes illegal coercion.
- Frequent and aggressive attempts by CMS to secure signatures on documents during a forbearance period.
- Found evidence of inflated mortgage figures used in financial documents, indicative of broader financial fraud.
- Discovered the forgery of documents intended to illegally modify the mortgage agreement.
- Uncovered collusion with local developers to manipulate the outcome of the foreclosure auction.
- Actions by BoA suggest a violation of Idaho's Consumer Protection Act through unfair and deceptive practices.
- BoA attempted to enforce backdated agreements to legitimize fraudulent claims on the property.
- CMS backdating of documents to 2012, despite being in 2021, suggests premeditated fraud potentially relevant to a civil RICO claim.
- Observed discrepancies in the assignment and notification process of the loan transfer, further complicating the legal standing of actions against the property.
- BoA engaged in activities that directly contravene the principles of equity and justice, as evidenced by their handling of the second mortgage.
- BoA's systematic efforts to undermine legal proceedings and obfuscate their fraudulent activities have significantly impacted financial stability and legal rights.
- The involvement of a local developer in the foreclosure auction indicates a premeditated strategy to undervalue and acquire the property.
- The wrongful conduct and various forms of fraud perpetrated by BoA reveal a broader pattern of abuse and deception.
- Unauthorized creation of a second mortgage by BoA and CMS.
- CMS, acting for BoA, collected payments on invalidated accounts.
- Conspiracy with local developers by BoA to depress the property's sale value at auction.
- The foreclosure auction proceeded despite a verbal agreement to postpone, which was recorded.
- Coerced into signing backdated documents by BoA to legitimize a fraudulently created mortgage.
- Discovery of forged documents intended to illegally alter the mortgage agreement by BoA.
- Misrepresentation of loan status and fraudulent financial activities by BoA to manipulate stock prices.
- Fraudulent concealment of a second mortgage by BoA, putting the property at significant risk.
- Continued acceptance of payments on invalidated accounts by BoA.
- Violations of Idaho's Consumer Protection Act through unfair and deceptive practices by BoA.
- Emotional distress and damage to credit caused by ongoing fraudulent activities and legal battles with BoA.
- Concealment of the second mortgage and its satisfaction by BoA, violating principles of equity and justice.
- Negligent misrepresentation of the loan status by BoA, creating unauthorized financial instruments.
- BoA breached the contract by creating a second deed of trust without proper assignment.
- Engaged in similar fraudulent activities in other cases, not just mine, by BoA.
- Attempt by BoA to have me sign a backdated new promissory note to cover up their fraudulent activities.
- Allegations by BoA suggest borrowing money for a down payment on another loan, potentially violating lending regulations.
- Commitment of fraud by BoA by concealing the existence of a second mortgage, which put me at significant risk.
- The legality of borrowing money for a down payment on another loan is questioned, highlighting potential violations of lending regulations by BoA.

These actions not only threatened my property but also demonstrated a broader pattern of conduct that potentially implicates BoA and its associates in substantial legal and civil violations.

**Urgent Need for Investigative and Legal Intervention**

The detailed allegations and documented evidence I present underscore not only the profound personal impact of these actions but also the potential for widespread systemic implications. The fraudulent activities and legal violations I have uncovered suggest a deliberate and coordinated effort to undermine legal and financial standards on a national scale. This situation demands not only a halt to the foreclosure process but also a comprehensive review of the actions by BoA, Carrington Mortgage Services, ReconTrust, and associated developers and law firms.

**Request for Action**

Given the scale and severity of these issues, and in light of my forced position to navigate this complex landscape pro se, I implore your office to take immediate action. A thorough investigation into these matters is imperative—not only to address the injustices I have faced but to prevent further harm to the American public and to restore faith in our financial and legal systems., I urgently request your office to:

- Conduct a thorough investigation into the foreclosure auction and related practices of BoA, Carrington Mortgage Services, and ReconTrust.
- If the pattern I uncovered is followed nationwide, you will more than likely find thousands of other homeowners defrauded in the same manner
- Review the legality of the foreclosure auction, including potential collusion and intimidation tactics.
- Assess the broader implications of these entities' actions on consumer rights and financial regulations.

I am prepared to provide all necessary documentation and evidence to support this investigation. The immediate attention to this matter could not only rectify the injustices I have faced but also uphold the law and protect individuals from corporate and financial malfeasance.

This multifaceted approach, encompassing both federal and state-level violations and oversight authorities, ensures thorough coverage and accountability across all relevant jurisdictions. I urge your immediate attention and action on these matters, supported by the enclosed evidence and detailed account of each violation. I am also sending this dossier to news outlets as well due to fear of being unduly subsided out of corruption as I have other matters pertaining to criminal behaviors that are outside this issue at hand. Those range from an attempt on my life by a Pinkerton Agent who sits on an Executive Threat Team for one of the biggest corporations to a DOJ agent who is on the take for a corporation that helped suppress my efforts for justice to uncovering an extortion ring of doctors that is spreading nationwide, to the SA of a child that stretched cross state borders involving Methamphetamine.

**Conclusion**

The actions leading to and including the foreclosure auction of my home represent a clear disregard for legal standards and ethical practices. I implore your office to take swift action to investigate these matters thoroughly and ensure accountability and justice for the wrongs committed. The urgency of this situation cannot be overstated, and I eagerly await your prompt and decisive response.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this urgent plea. I am available to provide further information or documentation as needed and look forward to your prompt response.

Sincerely,

Lender may accept any payment or paitial payment insufficient to bring the Loan current, without waiver of any rights hereunder or prejudice to its rights to refuse such payment or partial payments in the future, but Lender is not obligated to apply such payments at the time such payments are accepted. If each Periodic Payment is applied as of its scheduled due date, then Lender need not pay interest on l.lnapplied funds.

If more than one Periodic Payment is outstanding, Lender may apply any payment received from Borrower to the repayment of the Periodic Payments if, and to the extent that, each payment can be paid in foll. To the extent that any excess exists after the payment is applied to the full payment of one or more Periodic Payments, such excess may be applied to any late charges due.

Lender may waive Borrower's obligation to pay to Lender Funds for any or all Escrow Items at any time. Any such waiver may only be in writing. In the event of such waiver, Borrower shall pay directly, when and where payable, the amounts due for any Escrow Items for which payment of Funds has been waived by Lender and, if Lender requires, shall furnish to Lender receipts evidencing such payment within such time period as Lender may require. Borrower's obligation to make such payments and to provide receipts shall for all purposes be deemed to be a covenant and agreement contained in this Security Instrument, as the phrase "covenant and agreement" is used in Section 9. If Borrower is obligated to pay Escrow Items directly, pursuant to a waiver, and Borrower fails to pay the amount due for an Escrow Item, Lender may exercise its rights under Section 9 and pay such amount and Borrower shall then be obligated under Section 9 to repay to Lender any such amount. Lender may revoke the waiver as to any or all Escrow Items at any time by a notice given in accordance with Section 15 and, upon such revocation, Borrower shall pay to Lender all Funds, and in such amounts, that are then required under this Section 3.

Borrower and Lender can agree in writing, however, that interest shall be paid on the Funds. Lender sllall give to Borrower, without charge, an annual accounting of the Funds as required by RESP A.

Borrower shall also be responsible for the payment of any fees imposed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in connection with the review of any flood zone determination resulting from an objection by Borrower. If Borrower fails to maintain any of the coverages described above, Lender may obtain insurance coverage, at Lender's option and Borrower's expense. Lender is under no obligation to purchase any particular type or amount of coverage. Therefore, such coverage shall cover Lender, but might or might not protect Borrower, Borrower's equity in the Property, or the contents of the Property, against any iisk, hazard or liability and might provide greater or lesser coverage than wa5 previously in effect. Borrower acknowledges that the cost of the insurance coverage so obtained might significantly exceed the cost of insurance that Borrower could have obtained.

Unless Lender nnd Borrower otherwise agree in writing, any insurance procc;eds, whether or not the underlying insurance was required by Lender; shall be applied to restoration or repair of the Property, if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and Lender's security is not lesse,rred. During such repair and restoration period, Lender shall have the right to hold such insurance proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender's satisfaction, provided that such inspection shall be undertaken promptly. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on such insurance proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such proceeds. Fees for public adjusters, or other thhd parties, retained by Borrower shall not be paid out of the insurance proceeds and shall be the sole obligation of Borrower. If the restoration or repair is not economically feasible or Lender's security would be lessened, the insurance proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower. Such insurance proceeds shall be applied in the order provided for in Section 2. If Borrower abandons the Property, Lender may file, negotiate and settle any available insurance claim and related matters.

If the insurance or condemnation proceeds are not sufficient to repair or restore the Property, Borrower is not relieved of "Borrower's obligation for the completion of such repair or restoration. Lender or its agent may make reasonable entries upon and inspections of the Property. If it has reasonable cause, Lender may inspect the interior of the improvements on the Property. Lender shall give Borrower notice at the time of or prior to such an interior inspection specifying such reasonable cause. 8. Borrower's Loan Application. Borrower shall be in default if, during the Loan application process, Borrower or any persons or entities acting at the direction of Borrower or with Borrower's knowledge or consent gave materially false, misleading, or inaccurate information or statements to Lender (or failed to provide Lender with material information) in connection with the Loan. Material represe.ntationB include, but are not limited to, representations concerning Borrower's occupancy of the Property as Borrower's principal residence. 9. Protection of Lender's Interest in the Property and Rights Under this Security Instrument. If (a) Borrower fails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument, (b) there is a legal proceeding that might significantly affect Lender's interest in rhe Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument (such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, probate, for condemnation or forfeiture, for enforcement of a lien which may attain priority over this Security Instrument or to enforce laws or regulations), or (c) Borrower has abandoned the Property, then Lender may do a.nd pay for whatever is reasonable or appropriate to protect Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument, including protecting andior assessing the value of the Property, and securing andior repairing the Property. Lender's actions can include, but are not limited to: (a) paying any sums secured by a lien which has priority over this Security Instrument; (b) appea.ting in court: and (c) paying reasonable attorneys' fees to protect its interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument, including its secured position in a bankruptcy proceeding. Securing the Property includes, but is not limited to, entering the Property to make repairs, change locks, replac:e or bqard up doors and windows, drain water from pipes, eliminate building or other code violations or dangerous conditions, and have utilities turned on or off. Although Lender may !alee action under this Section 9, Lender does not have to do so and is not under any duty or obligation to do so. It is agreed that Lender incurs no liability for not taking any or all actions authorized under this Section 9. Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 9 shall become additional debt. of Borrower secured by chis Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from the dace of disbursement and shall be payable, wirh sv.ch interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment. If this Security Instrument is on a leasehold, Borrower shall comply with all the provisions of the lease. If Borrower acquires fee title to the Property, the leasehold and the fee title shall not merge unless Lender agrees to the merger in writing. 10. Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the Loan, Borrower shall pay the premiums required to maintain the Mortgage Insurance in effect. If, for any reason, the Mortgage Insurance coverage required by Lender ceases to be available from the mortgage insurer that previously provided such insurance and Borrower was required to make separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Bonower shall pay the premiums required to obtain coverage substantially equivalent to the Mortgage Insma.i1ce previously in effect, at a cost substantially equivalent to the cost to Borrower of the Mortgage Insurance previously in effect, from an altemate mortgage insurer selected by Lender. If substantially e,quivalent Mortgage Insurance coverage is not available, Borrower shall cominue to pay to Lendcr the amount of the separately designated payments that were due when the insurance coverage ceased to be in effect. Lender will accept, use and retain these payments as a non-refundable loss reserve in lieu of Mortgage Insurance. Such loss reserve shall be non-refundable, notwithstanding the fact that the L-0an is ultimately pa.id in full, imd Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such loss reserve. Lender can rio longer require loss reserve payments if Mmtgage Insurance coverage (in the amount and for the period that Lender requires) provided by an insurer selected by Lender again becomes available, is obtained, and Lender requires s·eparately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of maldng the Loan and Borrower was required to make separately designated payment~ toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower shall pay the premiums required to maintain Mortgage Insurance in effect, or to provide a non-refundable loss reserve, until Lender's requirement for Mortgage Insurance ends in accordance with any written agreement between Borrower and Lender providing for such termination or until termination is required by Applicable Law. Nothing in this Section 10 affects Borrower's obligation to pay interest at the rate pmvided in the Note. CHL (08100) Page 6 oi 11 DOC ID#: 0008545953212004 Mortgage Insurance reimburses Lender (or any entity that purchases the Note) for certain losses it may incur if Borrower does not repay the Loan as agreed, Borrower is not a party to the Mortgage Insurance, Mortgage insurers evaluate their total risk on all such insurance in force from time to time, and may enter into agreements with other parties tllat share or modify their risk, or re.duce losses. These agreements are on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to the mortgage insurer and the other party (or parties) to these agreements. These agreements may require the mortgage insurer to make payments using any source of funds that the mortgage insurer may have available (which may include funds obtained from Mortgage Insurance premiums). As a result of these agreements, Lender, any purchaser of the Note, another insurer, any reinsurer, any other entity, or any affiliate of any of the foregoing, may receive (directly or indirectly) amounts Ihat derive from (or might be characterized as) a portion of Borrower's payments for Mortgage Insurance, in exchange for sharing or modifying the mortgage insurer's risk, or reducing losses. If such agreement provides that an affiliate of Lender tak<es a ,:hare of the insurer's risk in exchange for a share of the premiums paid to the insurer, the arrangement is often rermed "captive reinsurance." Further: (a) Any such agreements will not affect the amounts that Borrower has agreed to pay for Mortgage Insurance, or any other terms of the Loan. Such agreements will not increase the amount Borrower will owe for Mortgage Insurance, and they will not entitle Borrower to any refund. (b) Any such agreements ~ill not affect the rights Borrower has · if any • with respect to the Mortgage Insurance under the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 or any other law. These rights may include the right to receive certain disclosures, to request and obtain cancellation of the Mortgage Insurance, to have the Mortgage Insurance tenninated automatically, and/or to receive a refund of any Mortgage Insurance premhnns that were unearned at the time of such cancellation or termination. 11. Assignment of .Miscellaneous Proceeds; Forfeiture. All Miscellaneous Proceeds are hereby assigned to and shall be paid to Lender. lf the Property is damaged, such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to restoration or repair of the Property, if the restoration ar repair is economically feasible and Lender's security is not lessened. During such repair and restoration period, Lender shall have the right to hold such Miscellaneous Proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender's satisfaction, provided that such inspection shall be undertaken promptly. Lender may pay for the repairs and restoration in a single disbursement or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on such Miscellaneous Proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such Miscellaneous Proceeds. If the restoration or repair is not economically feasible or Lender's security would be lessened, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower. Such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied in the order provided for in Section 2. In the event of a total taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower. In the event of a partial taking, destrnction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market value of the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is equal to or greater than the amount of the sum:; secured by this Security Instrument immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value, unless Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing, the sums secured by this Security Instrument shall be reduced by the amount of the Miscellaneous Proceeds multiplied by the following fraction: (a) the total amount of the :;urns secured immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value divided by (b) the fair mark<ot value of the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value. Any balance shall be paid to Borrower. In the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market value of the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is less than the amount of the sums secured immediatdy before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value, unless Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument whether or not the sums are then due. If the Property is abandoned by Borrower, or if, after notice by Lender to Borrower that the Opposing Party (as defined in the next sentence) offers to make an award to settle a claim for damages, Borrower fails to respond to Lender within 30 days after the date the notice is given, Lender is authorized to collect and apply the Miscellaneous Proceeds either to restoration or repair of the Property or to the sums secure,d by this Security Instn1ment, whether or not then due. "Opposing Party" means the third party that owes Borrower Miscellaneous Proceeds or the party against whom Borrower has a right of action in regard to Miscellaneous Proceeds. Borrower shall be in default if any action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, is begun that, in Lender's judgment, could result in forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender's interest in the Prope.rty or rights under this Security Instrument. B01Tower can cure such a default and, if acceleration has occurred, reinstate as provided in Section 19, by causing the action or proceeding to be dismissed with a ruling that, in Lender's judgmeqt, precludes forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender's interest in the Property or rights under this Security Instrument. The proceeds of any award or claim far damagas <Mt w, ,tmb,,tablo to <Ito impffimocPt of Load"'' iom~, m ,h, Property ru, h&f ~mgocd aod shall be paid to Lender. /.k?f;'j:' , lnltlas: ~ ~®6A(1D)(OOG5) CHL[OB/00) Page7of11 For 1101 DOC ID#; 0008545953212004 All Miscellaneous Proc,~eds that are not applied to restoration or repair of the Property shall be applied in the order provided for in Sec1fon 2. 12. Borrower Not R~,leased; Forbearance By L~nder Not a Waiver. Extension of the :rime for payment or modification of amortization of the sums secured by this Security Tnstrnmem granted by Lender to Borrower or any Successor in Interest of Borrower shall nm operate to release the liability of Borrower or any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Lender shall not be required to commence proceedings against any Successor in Interest of Borrower or to refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modify amortization of the smns secured by this Security Instrument by reason of any demand made by the original Borrower or any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Any forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy including, without limitation, Lender's acceptance of paymenl~ from third persons, entities or Successors in Interest of Borrower or in amounts less than the amount then due, shall not be a waiver of or preclude k'1e exercise of any right or remedy. 13. Joint and Several Liability; Co-signers; Successors and Assigns Bound. Borrower covenants and agrees that Borrower's obligations and liability shall be joint and several. However, any Borrower who co-signs this Security Instrument but does not execute the Note (a "co-signer"): (a) is co-signing this Security Instrument only to mortgage, grant and convey the co-signer's interest in the Property under the tenns of this Security Instrument; (b) is not personally obligated to pay die sums secured by this Security Instrument; and (c) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower can agree to exrend, modify, forbear or make any accommodations with regard to the tem1s of this Security Instrument or the Note wi1110ut the co-signer's consent. Subject to the provisions of Section 18, any Successor in Interest of Borrower who assumes Borrower's obligations under this Security Instrument in writing, and is approved by Lender, shall obl:ain all of Borrower's rights and benefits under thifi Security Instrument. Borrower shall not be released from Borrower's obligations and liability under this Security Instrument unless Lender agrees to such release in writing. The covenants and agreements of this Secwity Instrument shall bind (except as provided in Section 20) and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender. 14. Lmm Charges. Lender may charge Borrower fees for services performed in connection with Bol'l'ower's default, for the pUl'pose of protecting Lender's interest in the Properly and righls under this Security Instn1ment, including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees, property inspection and valuation fees. In regard to any other fees, the absence of express authority in this Security Instrument to charge a specific fee to Borrower shall not be construed as a prohibition on the charging of such fee. Lender may not charge fees that are expressly prohibited by this Secmity Instrument or by Applicable Law. If the Loan is subject to a law which sets maximum loan charges, and that law is fmally interpreted so that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with the Loan exceed the pem1itted limits, then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce U1e charge lo the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from Borrower which exceeded pem1itted limits will be refunded to Borrower. Lender may choose to make this refund by reducing the principal owed under the Note or by maldng a direct payment to Borrower. If a refund reduces principal, the reduction will be treated as a partial prepayment without any prepayment charge (whether or not a prepayment charge is provided for under the Note). Borrower's acceptance of any such refund made by direct payment to Borrower will constitute a waiver of any right of action Borrower might have arising out of such overcharge. 15. Notices. All notice, given by Borrower or Lender in connection with this Security Instrument must be in writing. Any notice to Borrower in connection with this Security Instrument shall be deemed to have been given to Borrower when mailed by first class mail or when actually delivered to Borrower's notice address if sent by other means. Notice to any one Borrower shall constitute notice to all Borrowers unless Applicable Law expressly requires otherwise. The notice address shall be the Property Address unless Borrower has designated a substitute notice address by notice to Lender. Borrower shall promptly notify Lender of Borrower's change of address. If Lender specifies a procedure for reporting Borrower's change of address, then Borrower shall only report a change of address through that specified procedure. There may be only one designated notice address under this Securiiy Instrument at any one time. Any notice to Lender shall be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to Lender's address stated herein unless Lender has designated another address by notice to Bonower. Any notice in connection with d1is Security Instrument shall not be deemed to have been given to Lende1· until actually received by Lender. If any notice required by this Security Instrument is also required under Applicable Law, the Applicable Law requirement will satisfy the corresponding requirement under this Security Instrument. 16. Governing Law; Severability; Rules of Construction. This Securiiy Instrument shall be governed by federal law and the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located. AJl rights and obligations contained in this Security lnstrument are subject to any requirements and limitations of Applicable Law. Applicable Law might explicitly or implicitly allow the parties to agree by contract or it might be silent, but such silence shall not be construed as a prohibition against agreement by contract. In the event that any provision or clause of this Security Instrument or the Note conflicts with Applicable Law, such co11flict shall not affect other provisions of this Security Instrument or the Note which can be given effect without the conflicting provision. As used in this Security Instrument: (a) words of the masculine gender shall mean and include corresponding neuter words or words of the femmine gender; (b) words m the singular shall mean and include the. plural and vice versa; and (c) the word "may" gives sole drncretion without any obltLi take :yiy action.(l I lrnt\a!s J/ ~-6A(ID) (0005) CHL (08100) Page 8 ot 11 Fo~ 1 1 ® G/ DOC ID#: 0008545953212004 17. Borrower's Copy. Borrower shall be given one copy of the Note and ofthis Security Instrument. 18. Transfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Borrower. As used in this Section 18, "Interest in the Property" means any legal or beneficial interest in the Property, including, but not limited to, those beneficial interests transferred in a bond for deed, contract for deed, installment sales conttact or escrow agreement, the intent of which is the transfer of title by Borrower at a future date to a purchaser. If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if Borrower is not a naturrJ person and a beneficial inierest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without Lender's prior written consent, Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument. However, this option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law. If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice shall provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with Section 15 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without further notice or demand on Borrower. 19. Borrower's Right 1to Reinstate After Acceleration. If Borrower meets certain conditions, Borrower shall have the right to have enforcement of this Security Instrument discontinued at any time prior to the earliest of: (a) five days before sale of the Property pursuant to any power of sale contained in this Security Instrument; (b) such other period as Applicable Law might specify for the termination of Bon-ower's right to reinstate; or (c) entry of a judgment enforcing this Security Instrument. Those conditions are that Borrower: (a) pays Lender all sums which then would be due under this Security Instrument and the Note as if no acceleration had occurred; (b) cures any default of any other covenants or agreements; (c) pays all expenges incurred in enforcing this Security Instrument, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, property inspection and valuation fees, and other fees incurred for the purpose of protecting Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument; and (d) takes such action as Lender may reasonably require to assure that Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument, and Borrower's obligation to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument, shall continue unchanged. Lender may require that Borrower pay such reinstatement sums and expenses in one or more of the following fom1s, as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (b) money order; (c) certified check, bank check, treasurer's check or cashier's check, provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality or entity; or (d) Electronic Funds Transfer. Upon reinstatement by Borrower, this Security Instn1mem and obligations secured hereby shall remain fully effective as if no acceleration had occurred. However, this right to reinstate shall not apply in the case of acceleration under Section 18. 20. Sale of Note; Change of Loan Servicer; Notice of Glievance. The Note or a partial interest in the Note (together with this Security Instrument) cac'l be sold one or more times without prior notice to Borrower. A sale might result in a change in the entity (known as the "Loan Servicer") that collectg Periodic Payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument and performs other mortgage Joan servicing obligations under the Note, this Security Instrument, and Applicable Law. There also might be one or more changes of the Loan Servicer unrelated to a sale of the Note. If there is a change of the Loan Servicer, Borrower will be given written notice of the change which will state the name and address of the new Loan Servicer, the address to which payments should be made and any other information RESPA requires in conne.ction with a notice of transfer of servicing. If the Note is sold and thereafter the Loan is serviced by a Loan Servicer other than the purchaser of the Note, the mortgage loan servicing obligations to Borrower will remain with the Loan Servicer or be transferred to a successor Loan Servicer and are not as,qumed by the Note purchaser unless otherwise provided by the Note purchaser. Neither Borrower nor Lender may commence, join, or be joined to any judicial action (as either an individual litigant or the member of a class) that arises from the other party's actions pursuant to this Security Instrument or that alleges that tile other party has breached any provision of, or any duty owed by reason of, this Security Instrument, umil such Borrower or Lender has notified the other party (with such notice given in compliance with the requirements of Section 15) of such alleged breach and afforded the other party hereto a reasonable period after the giving of such notice to take corrective action. If Applicable Law provides a time period which must elapse before certain action can be tal<en, that time period will be deemed to be reasonable for purposes of this paragraph. The notice of acceleration and opportunity to cure given to Borrower pursuant to Section 22 and the notice of acceleration given to Borrower pursuant to Section 18 shall be deemed to satisfy the notice and opportunity to take corrective action provisions of this Section 20. 21. Hazardous Substan,ces. As used in this Section 21: (a) "Hazardous Substances" are those substances defined as toxic or hazardous substances, pollutants, or wastes by Environmental Law and the following substances: gasoline, kerosene, other flammable or toxic petroleum products, toxic pesticides and herbicides, volatile solvents, materia.ls containing asbestos or formaldehyde, and radioactive materials; (b) "Environmental Law" means federal laws and laws of the jurisdiction where the Property is located that relate to health, safety or environmental protection; (c) "Environmental Cleanup" includes any response action, remedial action, or removal action, as defined in Environmental Law; and (d) an "Environmental Condition" means a condition that can cause, contribute to, or otherwise trigger nn Environmental Cleanup. Borrower shall not caiuse or permit the presence, use, disposal, storage, or release of any Hazardous Substances, or threaten to release any Hazardous Substances, on or in the Property. Borrower shall not do, nor allow anyone else to do, anythillg affecting the Property (a) that is in violation of any Environmental Law, (b) which creates an Environm,mtal Condition, or (c) which, due to the presence, use, or releasrt}fazardo~ ···"'"'""OOSJ '"""'.'' ·~""" """'~'fl DOC ID#: 0008545953212004 Substance, creates a condition thl\t adversely affects the value of the Property. The preceding two sentence,~ shall not apply to the presence, use, or storage on the Property of small quantities of Hazardous Substances that ase generally recognized to be appropriate to normal residential uses and to maintenance of the Property (including, but not limited to, hazardous substances in consumer products). Borrower shall prompd.y give Lender written notice of (a) any invesiigation, claim, demand, lawsuit or other action by any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property and any Hazardous Substance or Environmental Law of which Borrower has actual knowledge, (b) ilJly Environmental Condition, including bui not limited to, any spilling, leaking, discharge, release or threat of release of any Hazardous Substance, and (c) any condition caused by the presence, use or release of a Hazardous Substa.rice which adversely affects the value of the Property. If Borrower learns, or is notified by any govemmental or regulatory authority, or any private party, that any removal or other remediation of any Hazardous Substance affecting the Property is necessary, Borrower shall promptly take all necessary remedial actions in accordance with Environmental Law. Nothing herein shall create any obligation on Lender for an Environmental Cleanup. NON-UNIFORM COVENA.l\TTS. Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows: 22. Acceleration; Remedies. Lender shall give notice to Borrower prior to ac,celeration following Borrower's breach of any covenant or agreement in this Security Instrument (but not prior to acceleration under Section 18 unless Applicable Law provides othenvise).

The notice shall further infor"rn Borrower of the right to reinstate after acceleration iund the right to bring a court action to assert the non-existence of a default or any other defense of Borrower to acceleration and sale. If the default is not cured on or bet'ore the date specified in the notic,~, Lender at its option may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Secnrity Instrnment without further demand and may invoke the power of sale and any other remedies permitted by Applicable Law. Lender shall be entitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing the remedies provi.de\l. in this Section 22, including, bnt not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of title evidence. If Lender invokes tile power of sale, Lender shall execute or cause Trustee to execute written notice of the occurrence of an ev,mt of default and of Lender's election to cause tl1e Property to be sold, and shall cause such notice to be recorded in each county in which any part of' the Property is located. Lender or Trustee shall mail copies of the notice as prescribed by Applicable Law to Borrower and to other persons prescribed by Applicable Law.

SHEETS, JR. and DEBRA SHEETS; and DOES 1-10 as individuals with an interest in the property legally described as: Defendants. Case No. CV-2010-2564 DEFENDANTS' OBJECTION TO PLAINTIFF'S NOTICE REGARDING PLAN MOVING FORWARD AND PROPOSED FINAL JUDGMENT Defendants, RALPH E. SHEETS and DEBRA SHEETS (hereinafter "Defendants"), by and through their undersigned counsel, hereby object to the Notice Regarding Plan Going Forward (hereinafter the "Plan") and proposed Final Judgment (hereinafter the "Judgment"), both filed by Plaintiff on June 18, 2013 in response to the Court's Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order on Plaintiffs Motions for Summary Judgment issued on April 26, 2013 (hereinafter "Findings and Order"), and in support thereof state as follows: PLAINTIFFS PLAN AND PROPOSED JUDGMENT DO NOT COMPY WITH THE COURT'S FINDINGS AND ORDER DEFENDANTS' OBJECTION TO PLAINTIFF'S NOTICE REGARDING PLAN MOVING FORWARD AND PROPOSED FINAL JUDGMENT Page 1 1. Court expressly states that the its is to place back were as October 30, 2009. is repeated three times the Findings and Order (Pages 11, 12 and 13), and the Court elaborates as to its reason for this result. (Pages 12-13). The Court further notes that the underlying rescission action brought by Plaintiff was: "based on its own conduct and mistakes and that the issuance of the Deed of Reconveyance was done through absolutely no fault of the Sheets and that any action by BofA at this time to lay such blame at the feet of the Sheets or any actions to treat the current (2004) loan in a negative manner will be met with strong disapproval of this court." (Pages 12-13) 2. The Court goes on to state that it will "retain its discretion" to ensure that the Sheets are treated properly under the existing terms and obligations of the Note and Deed of Trust. (Page 13). 3. Further, the Court required as a pre-condition to "the entry of a Judgment or further orders" that BofA present a detailed plan in which BofA sets forth its proposal as to how to move forward with its relationship with Sheets. (Page 12) By definition, placing the parties back in the position that they occupied on October 30, 2009, would require re-establishing the principal balance of the Note at approximately $43,264.00, and fully reinstating the 2004 Loan. After entry of Judgment and release of the Lis Pendens, interest would again begin to accrue at the rate set forth in the Note, unless the parties agreed to a modification or refinance of the Loan. The Sheets would resume payments of principal and interest under the Note until paid or refinanced with either BofA or another lender. 4. Unfortunately, the Plan put forward by Plaintiff does not comply with the conditions set forth in the Findings and Order to put the parties back in the position they occupied as of October DEFENDANTS' OBJECTION TO PLAINTIFF'S NOTICE REGARDING PLAN MOVING FORWARD AND PROPOSED FINAL JUDGMENT Page 2 30, 2009. BofA attempts to claim both interest and principal payments as being due n'"'1'"1""''n October 30, 2009 and present ( see attached Reinstatement Calculation dated 8/2013), ignores both the Court's directive and the undisputed fact that the Full Reconveyance recorded by ReconTrust Company N.A. (copy attached) expressly recited that the underlying Note had been surrendered for cancellation. Plaintiff also argues that it is entitled to recovery of $70,000.00 in attorney fees and other costs, but then offers to waive those fees and costs if the Defendants agree to 'bring the loan current" and waive any rights of appeal. However, the Plan is silent as to what steps, if any, BofA would take to correct still listed credit entries previously made with regard to the 2004 Loan, or what incentives or assistance Plaintiff would offer Defendants to facilitate them refinancing with another lender. 5. In addition to proposing a course of action that does not comply with the Court's directive, Plaintiff now throws another curve by alleging that it is powerless to make any assurances that the Sheets can get any type of modification of their existing loan, because the true owner of the loan is Fannie Mae. If Fannie Mae was the owner of the loan at the time that this action was originally filed, why was the action not filed in its name? Conversely, if Fannie Mae was not the true owner when suit was filed, why was the loan transferred during the course of litigation. Finally, it is not credible to believe that BofA is not in a position to repurchase a $43,000 loan for the purpose of resolving a case that has gone on for over 3 years. 6. The final problem with Plaintiffs Plan is that it does not condition entry of Judgment on completion of remedial actions required by the Court's Findings and Order. Rather, Plaintiff seeks a blanket Judgment which does not incorporate any requirements of the Findings and DEFENDANTS' OBJECTION TO PLAINTIFF'S NOTICE REGARDING PLAN MOVING FORWARD AND PROPOSED FINAL JUDGMENT Page 3 and which provides the Sheets no assurance that any further action will be taken to or modify 2004 Loan, or put a position to a third party refinancing. Under the Plan as submitted, BofA gets all the benefits of rescission of the Deed of Reconveyance, but can thereafter wash its hands of further responsibility moving forward. Given the extremely poor track record that BofA has in dealing with loan modifications in general, and the undisputed lack of diligence and competence it has shown in previous dealings with the Sheets, the Plan as presently configured is fundamentally flawed and unfair, and should be rejected by the Court. 7. Plaintiff makes a number of allegations in its Plan which are expressly disputed by Defendants and counsel, and which will be addressed in detail should this matter be scheduled for hearing. In particular, Defendants specifically reject any claim that they did not mediate in good faith, when in fact it was BofA who failed to put forth any settlement offer that did not include payment of interest and principal attributable to the period after the Deed of Reconveyance was recorded to the present. However, prior to scheduling this objection for hearing, counsel for Defendants will contact opposing counsel directly and attempt to reach a resolution consistent with the Court's directive. In the meantime, Defendants request that the Court take no further action on Plaintiffs proposed Plan and Judgment, pending either resolution by the parties or hearing by the Court.

Case No. CV-2010-2564 DEFENDANTS'RESPONSE TO COURT'S REQUEST FOR LEGAL AUTHORITY COME NOW, the Defendants, Ralph E. Sheets and Debra Sheets (hereinafter "Defendants"), by and through their undersigned counsel, and file their Response to Court's Request for Legal Authority made at the hearing held on September 6, 2013 on Defendants' Objection the Proposed Plan Going Forward and Judgment filed by Plaintiff pursuant to the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order on Plaintiff's Motions for Summary Judgment issued on April 26, 2013 (the "Findings of Fact"), and in support thereof state as follows. In the interest of not repeating in detail pleadings or exhibits previously submitted, Defendants incorporate by reference Defendants' Brief in Opposition to Motions for Summary Judgment ("Defendants' Brief') and Defendants' Objection to Proposed Plan Going Forward and Judgment ("Defendants' Objection") as if fully set forth herein. DEFENDANTS' RESPONSE TO COURT'S REQUEST FOR LEGAL AUTHORITY Page 1 1. At the September 6th hearing, the Court requested that counsel for the parties submit legal authority as to the boundaries of authority that the Court has within which to craft a decision and legal remedy for Plaintift's pending action for equitable rescission of a Full Reconveyance of a deed of trust and promissory note (the "Reconveyance"), which was recorded through the error, gross negligence, and dishonest conduct of employees and agents of Plaintiff, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., n/k/a BAC Home Loans, Inc. (hereinafter "Plaintiff'). The Court's request was based in part on its stated frustration that the parties have been unable to reach a settlement of the pending case, and it is with full respect of the Court's efforts to resolve this matter that Defendants make the arguments set forth herein. 2. It is imperative to keep in mind that Plaintift's Complaint only sets forth a single cause of action, that being a request for equitable rescission based on mistake. While this case has been pending since April 2010, Plaintiff has made no effort to amend its Complaint or add any additional causes of action. Specifically, Plaintiff has failed to plead any causes of action based on either breach of contract or declaratory relief. This is despite the Court having brought the issue to the attention of Plaintift's counsel during the early stages of this case. 3. As has been argued consistently by counsel for Defendants, the sole legal basis of Bank of America's request is unilateral mistake, and there is a complete absence of any allegations or evidence establishing that (a) the filing of the Reconveyance was the result of any mutual mistake; or (b) that the unilateral mistake was in any way caused by the actions of Defendants. 4. There is also no factual disagreement that the Reconveyance was filed by Plaintiff following almost a year of continuous mistakes and miscommunications by Plaintiff and various subsidiaries thereof, in connection with what should have been a routine refinancing of Defendants' prior existing home loan (hereinafter the "2004 Loan"). DEFENDANTS' RESPONSE TO COURT'S REQUEST FOR LEGAL AUTHORJTY Page 2 5. Prior to filing of Plaintiffs Motions for Summary Judgment, Plaintiff had previously filed and argued both a Motion to Dismiss Counterclaims and a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, both of which motions were substantively denied by the Court. 6. At the time that Plaintiff filed its Motions for Summary Judgment, Plaintiff failed to submit any affidavits or other evidence from any employees of Bank of America having actual knowledge of the underlying dispute which in any way refuted Defendants' version of events. The scope of the affidavits filed by Plaintiff focused exclusively on the amounts allegedly due and owing under the underlying promissory note and the summary statement that the Reconveyance was filed by mistake. 7. No documentation produced by Plaintiff in response to Requests for Production, fully explains how the alleged mistake that Plaintiff now seeks to rescind occurred, even though such an explanation is an essential requirement for determining whether Plaintiff is legally entitled to the equitable relief being sought. 8. The Court erred in Granting Full Summary Judgment. Given the nature of the relief plead by Plaintiff, the Court erred in granting full summary judgment. Summary judgment in Idaho is governed by I.R.C.P. 56, which is patterned on F.R.C.P. Rule 56. There is a plethora of cases (both Idaho and federal) interpreting this rule, and the burden of proof and standard of review are well established, and set forth in detail in Defendants' prior Brief. On summary judgment, a court must decide whether there is a "genuine issue as to any material fact, "not weigh the evidence or determine the truth of contested matters". Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a), (c); see also, Adickes v. S.H Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970). "Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge, whether he is ruling on a motion for summary judgment or for a directed verdict." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). The evidence of the party opposing summary judgment is to be believed and all reasonable inferences from the facts must be drawn in favor of the opposing party. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255; Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587. The Court must determine "whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter oflaw." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 251-252. DEFENDANTS' RESPONSE TO COURT'S REQUEST FOR LEGAL AUTHORITY Page 3 An issue of fact is genuine " 'if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.' 11 Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1061 (9th Cir.2002)(quotingAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) ). The court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. Id "Summary judgment cannot be granted where contrary inferences may be drawn from the evidence as to material issues. 11 Easter v. Am. W Fin. 381 F.3d 948 (9th Cir.2004)(citing Sherman Oaks Med. Arts Ctr., Ltd. v. Carpenters Local Union No.1936, 680 F.2d 594,598 (9th Cir.1982)). Summary judgment proceeding is not a substitute for trial of factual issues which are genuine and material. Tri State National Bank v. Western Gateway Storage Co. 447 P.2nd 409, 92 Idaho 543. Summary judgment is only appropriate when genuine issues of material fact are absent and the case can be decided as a matter of law. Edmondson v. Shearer Lumber Products, 75 P.3rd 733, 139 Idaho 172 If reasonable people could reach different conclusions based on the evidence, motion for summary judgment must be denied. Harpole v. State, 958 P.2nd 594, 131 Idaho 437 The burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact is on the party moving for summary judgment. Wattenbarger v. A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc., 246 P.2nd 961, 150 Idaho 308. The standards for granting summary judgment are of particular importance in the present case, because the Plaintiffs underlying claim seeks purely equitable relief, and is not supported by a specific stature or any case law directly on point. Rescission is not a favored remedy, and the standard of proof in most cases involving equitable relief is clear and convincing evidence. In seeking equitable relief, Plaintiff has the burden of overcoming equitable defenses, a number of which have been raised by Defendants. In order for Plaintiff to prevail on its motion for summary judgment, it was required to meet the burden of establishing that there was no material fact or issue pertaining to the counterclaims or equitable defenses pleaded and raised by Defendants. Plaintiff was also required to establish that it had not engaged in conduct that would preclude the equitable relief it seeks. Plaintiff did not come close to meeting that burden. The twenty-two (22) Undisputed Facts and Admissions set forth in Defendants' Summary Judgment Response established sufficient and unrefuted material issues of fact to preclude the entry of summary judgment, at least as related to Defendants' equitable defenses of estoppel and unclean hands. Defendants did not have the responsibility to proof those defenses at the time of the summary judgment hearing, only to establish that the issues were genuine and material. By issuing its Findings of Fact prior to hearing actual testimony from employees of Plaintiff as to DEFENDANTS' RESPONSE TO COURT'S REQUEST FOR LEGAL AUTHORITY Page 4 circumstances surrounding the recording of the Reconveyance, the Court improperly weighed evidence that it had not yet heard. Both Idaho and federal cases have consistently ruled that appellate review of a summary judgment decision is essentially a de novo review rather than a review that enjoys a presumption of correctness as to the court decision being reviewed. Reynolds v. Trout Jones Gledhill Fuhrman, P.A., 38933 Supreme Court ofldaho January 23, 2013. The reason for this heightened burden of proof on appeal is the fact that summary judgment rulings shortcut the trial process, and are expressly intended to be the exception rather than the rule. A trial judge is fully entitled to deny summary judgment when the more prudent course would be to proceed to a full trial, presumably because a trial creates a fuller record and affords a more substantial basis for evaluating evidence and witnesses and rendering a decision on the merits. In order for Plaintiff to have prevailed on its motions for summary judgment, there must have been an absence of any genuine dispute as to any material fact or issue and the movant must show that it is entitled to judgment as a matter oflaw. Neither of those thresholds were met. In the absence of such a showing by the movant, the non-moving party does not have any affirmative duty to establish its case as part of the summary judgment proceedings. Rather, the motion is simply to be denied in whole or in part. 9. The burden was on Plaintiff to establish that it was legally entitled to relief for a unilateral mistake? Given the fact that the Plaintiff has presented no evidence that this was a mutual mistake, rather than a unilateral mistake which took place entirely without fault of the Defendants, there is a material issue of whether it was a legally excusable mistake, eligible for the equitable remedy of rescission. O'Connor v. Harger Const., Inc., 188 P.3d 846, 145 Idaho 904 (Idaho 2008). A unilateral mistake is not normally grounds for relief. Moore v. Mullen, 855 P.2d 70, 123 Idaho 985 (Idaho App. 1993). To date, Plaintiff has been unable to cite any statute or on point case supporting its Complaint for rescission. That burden is on Plaintiff, not the Defendants. More importantiy, Plaintiff has been unable or unwilling to explain how the series of mistakes took place. The material legal issue remains whether an action for rescission that arises from an admittedly DEFENDANTS' RESPONSE TO COURT'S REQUEST FOR LEGAL AUTHORITY Page 5 unilateral mistake of the Plaintiff qualifies for equitable relief at all, much less through the vehicle summary judgment. 10. The Beltron and \Vigner Documents were sufficient evidence of Unclean Hands to preclude Summary Judgment. Since Plaintiffs Complaint sounds solely in equity, it is subject to all applicable equitable defenses, including but not limited to the long established defense of unclean hands. The Idaho Supreme Court in the case of Ada County Highway Dist. v. Total Success Investments, LLC, 179 P.3d 323, 145 Idaho 360 (Idaho 2008) set forth the general concept of unclean hands as relates to actions in equity as follows: The clean hands doctrine "stands for the proposition that 'a litigant may be denied relief by a court of equity on the ground that his conduct has been inequitable, unfair and dishonest, or fraudulent and deceitful as to the controversy in issue.' " Gilbert v. Nampa Sch. Dist. No. 131, 104 Idaho 137,145,657 P.2d 1, 9 (1983) (citing 27 Am. Jur. 2d Equity§ 136 (1996)). [E]quity will consider the conduct of the adversary, the requirements of public policy, and the relation of the misconduct to the subject matter of the suit and to [the] defendant. Id at 14 5-46, 657 P .2d at 9-10 (internal quotations and citations omitted). While the unclean hands doctrine may not be a favored doctrine, it is still in effect, and the Court should have allowed the issue to go to trial and required Plaintiffs employees and agents to testify before making the final determination as to whether the evidence supported application of the defense. 11. The Court may have exceeded its authority under I.C. 10-1210 In its Findings of Fact, the Court bases its decision largely on authority granted courts pursuant to LC. 10-1210 to issue declaratory judgments. According to the Casemaker database there are 39 reported cases in Idaho that make express reference to LC. 10-1210. However, a review of the procedural history of those cases shows no instance where the court created a declaratory judgment in the absence of declaratory relief being actually pleaded by one of the parties, or both of the parties expressly agreeing to consider the pending action one for declaratory relief. DEFENDANTS' RESPONSE TO COURT'S REQUEST FOR LEGAL AUTHORITY Page 6 Neither of those conditions are present in this case. Further, a reading of the excerpt of the statute contained in the Court's Finding of Facts appears to require that declaratory relief be either affirmatively or defensively prayed for before the Court may exercise its declaratory authority. 11. Rescission should restore the status quo ante. Setting aside the question of whether the entry of summary judgment was correct, by granting Plaintiff the remedy of equitable rescission of the Reconveyance, the result should have been to place the parties back in the respective positions that they occupied immediately before the conduct occurred that required rescission. The Court expressly states this intention on Pages 11, 12 and 13 of the Findings of Fact. This concept of status quo ante has been recognized in a number of cases Barnard & Son, Inc. v. Akins, 708 P.2d 871, 109 Idaho 466 (Idaho 1985); Frink v. Thomas, 20 Or. 265, 25 P. 717, 12 L.R.A. 239; Howard v. Jackson, 213 Or. 447,459,324 P.2d 757. As stated in the Findings of Fact, the Court states its intention to place the parties back in the position they occupied at the end of October 2009. At that point, the principal balance on the 2004 Loan was approximately $43,500.00, and assuming that neither party appeals the ruling of the Court, the loan would then be reinstated and move forward accordingly. However, based on that concept, no interest, costs, or attorney fees incurred prior to rescission of the Reconveyance would be recoverable by either party. That conclusion was further contemplated by the express language of the Findings of Fact, wherein the Court pointedly reminded Plaintiff that the Reconveyance was Plaintiffs fault, and required Plaintiff to set forth a plan for dealing fairly with Defendants as a condition precedent to issuing final judgment. Finally, the Court expressly warned the Plaintiff against trying to "lay such blame at the feet of the Sheets", which is exactly what the Plaintiffs proposed plan does. The plain reading of the Court's Findings of Fact also makes equitable sense because it sets a clear reset point for both parties. Defendants can either choose to recommence payments under the 2004 Loan, or alternatively, can move with certainty to refinance with another lender. Conversely, the position being taken by Plaintiff is neither supported by the plain language of the Findings of Fact, the existing case law, or recognized concepts of equity. DEFENDANTS' RESPONSE TO COURT'S REQUEST FOR LEGAL AUTHORJTY Page 7 Plaintiff instead attempts to both rescind an legally inexcusable act, and simultaneously reap the economic benefit of acting as if the 2004 Loan debacle, the Reconveyance and the pending suit never happened. Plaintiffs proposed solution is for the Court to reinstate the status quo ante for a nanosecond and then flash forward to the present. There is no legal support for such a position, and it is inconsistent with the directive of the Court in the Findings of Fact. It also leaves the Defendants in an untenable position in that their attempts to refinance the 2004 Loan with a different lender cannot move forward because of the uncertainty of what is due and owing after rescission is clarified. Defendants have approached two different lenders, both of whom responded positively to a refinance, but neither of which will move forward without final resolution of the pending suit. Efforts to resolve this matter with Plaintiffs counsel have not been successful. In summary, while the Defendants do not agree with the ruling of the Court as set forth in the Findings of Fact, counsel would strongly recommend that they accept the decision set forth in the Findings of Fact as written, provided that: a. the status quo ante is fully restored; b. that the loan balance is reset to the outstanding principal existing on October 30, 2010, with all pre-rescission interest, late fees, penalties, costs and attorney fees waived; and c. that Plaintiff is required as a condition to entry of Final Judgment to follow through with its obligation to put forth a fair and equitable path moving forward that is consistent with the Court's directive and the nature of the relief sought by Plaintiff, including the filing of corrective reports to applicable credit agencies.

Defendants. Case No. CV-2010-2564 PLAINTIFFS' SUPPLMENT AL BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF PROPOSED PLAN AND ENTRY OF FINAL JUDGMENT Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. ("Countrywide"), Bank of America, N.A. and BAC Home Loan Servicing, L.P.1 ("Bank of America") and ReconTrust Company N.A.' s ("ReconTrust") (Countrywide, Bank of America, and ReconTrust are collectively referred to herein as the "Bank of America") by and through their attorneys of record, hereby submit their Supplemental Brief in Support of Proposed Plan and Entry of Final Judgment. 1 Bank of America Home Loan Servicing, L.P. is now known as Bank of America, N.A. 1 INTRODUCTION This Court docs not have authority to an equitable remedy remedy is available. Bank of America, N.A.'s (successor by merger to "Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.") (hereinafter "Bank of America") Complaint stated a claim for declaratory judgment based on the Loan Agreement between Bank of America and the Defendants. A court has equitable jurisdiction only if there is no adequate legal remedy. Claims involving express contracts, such as the Loan Agreement in this case, preclude the exercise of equitable jurisdiction. Furthermore, a declaratory judgment is a legal remedy and precludes the court's authority to enter an equitable remedy. FACTS On or about December 21, 2004, Defendant Ralph Sheets bonowed $65,250.00 from Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., d/b/a America's Wholesale Lender. Complaint filed March 30, 2010 (herein, the "Complaint) at ,i 6; admitted in Defendants' Amended Answer, Second Amended Counterclaims, Third Party Complaint, and Demand for Jury Trial, dated April 16, 2002 (herein, the "Answer and Counterclaims") at p. 2, ir 6 and p. 7, ,i 9. In order to bonow the money, Mr. Sheets executed a Deed of Trust pledging as security property commonly known as 5603 Highway 95, New Meadows, Idaho, 83654 (the "Property"). Complaint at ,i 6 and Exhibit A thereto. The Deed of Trust was recorded on December 28, 2004 as Instrument No. 107860. Deed of Trust, attached hereto as Exhibit 1. On November 9, 2009, the trustee erroneously recorded a reconveyance of said Deed of Trust, apparently as part of a proposed refinance that was not completed. Answer and Counterclaim at p. 11, fi 19. Bank of America did not intend for the trustee to record a reconveyance because the Note had not in face been paid in full. 2 PROCEDURAL HISTORY the Complaint this on March 30, 2010 to have the reconveyance of the Deed of Trust declared void. Three years of extensive litigation followed, which need not be set forth in detail here. On December 18, 2012, Bank of America filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on its Complaint. The Motion was opposed by Defendants. On April 29, 2013, this Court entered an order granting Bank of America's Motion for Summary Judgment. Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order on Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment at p. 13. (hereinafter "Findings of Fact"). In the Findings of Fact, the Court expressed its concern about the relationship between Bank of America and the Defendants moving forward. Findings of Fact at p. 12-13. The Court required Bank of America to present a detailed plan setting forth its proposal as to how to move forward in its relationship with the Defendants and additionally expressed that it would use its equitable powers to ensure that the Defendants "are treated properly under the existing terms and obligations of the Note and Deed of Trust moving forward." Id On June 18, 2013, Bank of America filed a Notice Regarding Plan Going Forward, which provided the Defendants with 120 days to either bring the loan current or apply for a loan modification with Bank of America. Notice Regarding Plan Going Forward at p. 5. (hereinafter the "Plan"). If the Defendants took either step within the time frame specified, Bank of America would waive all late fees, attorney fees, costs, and expenses relating to the payments of principal and interest not made by the defendant since October 2009 and the costs of this litigation. Id The Defendants objected to the proposed plan, and a hearing on the Defendants' objection was held on September 6, 2013. At the hearing, the Court requested supplemental briefing regarding its authority to grant equitable relief in this matter. ARGUMENT L The Court does not have equitable jurisdiction because an adequate legal remedv is available It is a well-established rule in Idaho that equitable claims will not be considered when an adequate legal remedy is available, Thomas v. Campbell, 690 P.2d 333, 339-40 (Idaho 1984), even if the legal action also involves equitable claims such that concurrent jurisdiction would ordinarily extend. Farmer v. Loofbourrow, 267 P.2d 113, 115 (Idaho 1954). Where an express contract exists between the parties, a claim based in equity is not allowed because it is precluded by the express contract. Iron Eagle Dev., LLC v. Quality Design Systems, Inc., 492, 65 P.3d 509,514 (Idaho 2003). Rescission, which historically is an equitable remedy, may be transformed into a legal remedy when it is codified in law or arises from an express contract. See, e.g. Mickelson v. Broadway Ford, Inc., 280 P.3d 176, 180 (Idaho 2012) (for the proposition that the codification of the remedy of rescission converts it from an equitable remedy to a legal remedy). The requirement that the obligation secured by the deed of trust have been paid in full prior to the reconveyance of the deed of trust, while originally arising in equity, has been codified into law in Idaho. LC. § 45-1202. This action arises from an express contract between the Defendants and Bank of America, memorialized in the Note and Deed of Trust (the "Loan Agreement"). The Loan Agreement specifically sets forth the Defendant's promise to repay the $65,250.00 he borrowed from Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., and his intention that said promise be secured by an interest in the Property. Deed of Trust p. 2. The Loan Agreement also set forth the conditions under which the Deed of Trust could be reconveyed. Deed of Trust~ 23. It is undisputed that those conditions were not satisfied, and that the amount secured by the Deed of Trust was not repaid. This Court may provide adequate legal remedy by declaring the reconveyance Because an adequate legal 1s available, the court is precluded from also entering an 2. Bank of America's complaint stated a claim for declaratorv relief A claim for declaratory judgment is made when a party asks the court "to declare the rights, status and legal relations of the parties." LC.§ 10-1201. In stating a claim for declaratory judgment, the plaintiff must show that there is a judiciable controversy between the parties and that "the judgment or decree will terminate the controversy or remove an uncertainty." I.C. § 10-1205. A "judiciable controversy" is one that "is appropriate for judicial determination ... definite and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests ... It must be a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be based upon a hypothetical state of facts." Harris v. Cassia County, 681 P.2d 988, 991 (Idaho 1984). Idaho has adopted a system of notice pleading. I.R.C.P. Rule 8; Youngblood v. Higbee, 182 P.3d 1199, 1203 (Idaho 2008). The general rules of pleading state that "no technical forms of pleading or motions are required" and "all pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice." I.R.C.P. Rule 8( e )(1 ),(f). A complaint need "only contain a concise statement of the facts constituting the cause of action and a demand for relief." Youngblood, 182 P.3d at 1203. Idaho law requires that all pleadings be so construed as to do substantial justice. Therefore, the fact that the claim is labeled as one for "rescission," should not prevent this court from treating it as a claim for declaratory judgment. Bank of America's Complaint in this action stated all of the facts necessary to state a claim for declaratory judgment and requested declaratory relief. The Complaint outlined the existence of a judiciable controversy regarding the status of the deed of reconveyance. 5 ,r 7, 9. The Complaint also outlined the specific relief requested, the voiding of the deed of which would conclusively end the controversy. Complaint~ 9. 3. In the alternative, Bank of America should be allowed to amend its complaint to include a claim for declaratory judgment In the alternative, if the Court finds that the Complaint did not state a claim for declaratory judgment, the Court should allow Bank of America to amend the Complaint pursuant to I.R.C.P. Rule 15 to include such a claim. Rule 15(a) states that the leave of the court to amend a pleading "shall be freely given when justice so requires" and Rule 15(b) states that the pleadings "may be amended as necessary to cause them to conform to the judgment upon motion of any party at any time, even afier judgment." (emphasis added). Such an amendment is appropriate unless the party opposing the amendment can show that he was prejudiced by the variance between the pleading and proof. Hughes v. Fisher, 129 P.3d 1223, 1234 (Idaho 2006). To do so a party must show that it was misled or unaware of the facts upon which the judgment was based and point to evidence it would have otherwise introduced or arguments that it would have otherwise made had it been aware of the unpled cause of action. Id. In the instant case, the evidence presented by the parties and the arguments of the parties fully supported a claim for summary judgment, as discussed above. Furthermore, the Defendants cannot claim that they had no notice that this case was being tried as a declaratory judgment case, as that fact was specifically referenced in Bank of America's Motion for Summary Judgment. Therefore, the Defendants would not be prejudiced by the amendment of the Complaint to state a claim for declaratory judgment. 4. In the alternative, voiding the deed of reconveyancc is a full and complete equitable remedy The purpose of an equitable remedy is "to restore the plaintiff to her entitlement, no more, no iess." Dan Dobbs, Dobbs Law of Remedies, 2d 118 (1993). Although incidental burdens may be imposed on third parties as the result of such restoration, the imposition of such burdens is not 6 objectionable unless the plaintiff obtained more than their entitlement. Id at 122. In most cases, the incidental burden does no more than force the third party to disgorge an entitlement that was never rightfully theirs in the first place. Id. at 122 n.19. A full and complete equitable remedy is entered by voiding the deed of reconveyance and restoring Bank of America to its entitlement to a security interest in the Property. It is true that this restoration imposes a burden on the defendants. However, that burden is limited to the fact that the promissory note that they executed to Bank of America is again secured by the Property. The Defendants have merely been disgorged from an entitlement to a property free and clear of all security interests that was never rightfully theirs to begin with. Bank of America does not dispute that the accounting errors and execution of the deed of reconveyance were the result of its own error. However, the Defendants have no actual damages stemming from the execution of the deed of reconveyance, and virtually no damages stemming from the sh011 term errors on their account which were resolved by Bank of America within a few months three years ago. The Defendants object to the proposed Plan because it requires them to make their past due payments of principal and interest. However, it is not equitable to force Bank of America to bear the cost of the Defendants' decision not to make the monthly payments that they were legally obligated to make under the promissory note. Nor should the Defendants be given the unwarranted benefit of three years without making payments on a loan while enjoying the benefits of the Property that loan allowed them to purchase. CONCLUSION This Court has no authority to order an equitable remedy regarding the Parties' relationship, when that relationship is governed by the terms of an express contract, and the Court's authority is 7 to rather However, the appropriate equitable remedy would be for the Court the deed reconvcyance, restoring to Bank of to entitlement.

Procedural History ) ) Case No. CV-2010-2564 ) ) ORDER ON PROPOSED JUDGMENT ) AND PLAN OF IMPLEMENTATION ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) On April 29, 2013, this court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order on Plaintiff's Motions for Summary Judgment in which it granted summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiff. However, as part of that order the court directed the parties to submit to the court information regarding Bank of America's (BofA) plan for proceeding with the processing of the loan at issue in this case. BofA filed its Notice Regarding Plan Going Forward on June 25, 2013. The Sheets responded with an Objection on July 3, 2013. Oral argument was held on September 6, 2013. On October 1, 2013, BofA filed a Supplemental Brief in Support of Proposed Plan and Entry of Final Judgment and Sheets filed a Response to Court's Request for Legal Authority. ORDER ON PROPOSED JUDGMENT AND PLAN OF IMPLEMENTATION -1 The court has determined that no additional oral argument is necessary and this order serves as final order on the pending issues in this action. Analysis As an initial matter, the court feels the need to address an argument raised by Sheets in the Defendants' Response to Court's Request for Legal Authority. In sections 8, 9 and 10 of that brief, Sheets' attorney identifies what he believes to be errors made by this court in granting summary judgment and appears to urge the court to reconsider its findings and decision in granting the Motion for Summary Judgment. The court will not consider or address these arguments because the Sheets have not filed a motion to reconsider in compliance with the applicable Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure that govern such requests for reconsideration. The ultimate issue asserted by the Complaint filed in this action was BofA's request that the court determine that the "deed of reconveyance should be declared null and void and the original deed of trust restored in the same force and effect as on the date originally executed and intended by Plaintiff and Sheets." (Complaint, 19). In the prayer for relief, BofA seeks as relief the following: a. For rescission of the deed of reconveyance recording in the mortgage records of Adams County, Idaho as Instrument No. 119343, and further declaring that the said deed of reconveyance is void and shall have no effect. b. That the deed of trust executed in favor of Plaintiffs predecessor in interest recorded on December 28, 2004 as Instrument No. 107860, mortgage records of Adams County, Idaho, together with all assignments thereunder shall be reinstated in full force and effect as and from the date originally executed. (Complaint, page 4). ORDER ON PROPOSED JUDGMENT AND PLAN OF IMPLEMENTATION -2 While BofA's does not state that the Plaintiff is pursuing this action as an action for a declaratory judgment pursuant to Idaho Code I 0-120 I, it did move the court for entry of summary judgment granting a "declaratory judgment" that the reconveyance erroneously recorded November 9, 2009 is void. The mistaken, unilateral release of loan security issue presented in this contract based dispute is appropriately addressed as an action for declaratory relief. The BofA' s complaint adequately gives notice of such a claim. The language of the Complaint as set forth above asks this court to "declare rights, status, and other legal relations" as is contemplated by Idaho Code 10-1201 in that the Complaint asks this court to declare the Deed of Reconveyance to be null and void and to determine that the Deed of Trust should be reinstated in full force and effect. This court cited Idaho Code 10-1201 as the basis on which it granted summary judgment on the issue of whether the mistakenly recorded deed of reconveyance should be rescinded. Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 8 and supporting case authority support this court's granting relief as a declaratory judgment because Idaho is a notice pleading state and that "no technical forms of pleading or motions are required." I.R.C.P. 8( e )(1 ). The court finds that the Complaint clearly sets forth the factual allegations of the transaction between the parties, as well as the request for a determination of legal rights and the remedies requested. While this court raised the issue throughout these proceedings in order to ensure that the matter was handled properly, the court after further consideration of the parties' arguments finds that the Complaint is sufficient to state a claim for declaratory judgment and the court has issued a decision on the basis of entry of declaratory judgment. This court has determined after carefully considering the positions of the parties along with all evidence and argument presented throughout this action, and specifically as presented in the Motion for Summary Judgment that there is not an issue of fact that the Deed of ORDER ON PROPOSED JUDGMENT AND PLAN OF IMPLEMENTATION -3 Reconveyance was mistakenly issued and should be determined to be null and void, and that the of as described above shall be reinstated with full force and effect The court incorporates by this reference the findings of fact and conclusions oflaw set forth in the court's April 29, 2013 order. Having made this determination, the court ordered Bank of America to present to the court a plan for moving forward in order to avoid any further complications in this action that would delay final resolution of the matter. BofA complied with this request and presented its argument and proposed plan which entails the following: • That Bank of America, relying on the underlying Note, finds that Sheets currently owes1 approximately $24,248.56 in past due principal and interest payments; • That Bank of America has advanced $1,201.68 in hazard insurance payments; • That Bank of America, relying on the underlying Note, finds that Sheets currently owes approximately $1212.17 in late fees; • That Bank of America is entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs; • That in order to resolve this matter, Bank of America will waive all late fees, attorney fees, costs, and expenses provided that Sheets pays all past due interest and fees; brings the loan current or timely applies for a loan modification; and that this litigation is concluded. • That Bank of America will not pursue collection of the unpaid amounts described above or pursue foreclosure while Sheets is attempting to accomplish a loan modification. In response to Bank of America's proposal, the Sheets argue that the plan does not comply with the spirit of the court's order and the court's finding that the parties shall be 1 As of the filing of the Notice Regarding Plan Going Forward filed on June 25, 2013. ORDER ON PROPOSED JUDGMENT AND PLAN OF IMPLEMENTATION -4 to the same relative positions existed as of October 30, 2009. The Sheets also argue determination should be extended to a finding that the principal of the Note should be as it was on that date -$43,264.00 and that the loan under the previous terms should be reinstated. Sheets further argue that they should then be allowed to resume payments under the Note under these terms until it is paid, or until a loan modification is accomplished. The court does not agree with the Sheets' interpretation or criticism of this court's Order. The court's Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order make it clear that the only issue before the court was reinstatement of the Deed of Trust and rescission of the Deed of Reconveyance based on its determination that the defenses and counterclaims asserted by the Sheets were unfounded. Neither the Complaint in this matter, nor the court's Order can be read to have any effect on the Sheets' obligations pursuant to the Note secured by the disputed Deed of Trust. The mistaken recordation of the Deed of Reconveyance did not relieve the Sheets of their obligation to BofA pursuant to the Promissory Note, dated December 21, 2004. At all times during this pending litigation, the Sheets have been or should have been aware that their obligations under that Note remained in effect and were not excused by the mistakenly recorded Deed of Reconveyance. When the court stated that the parties would be returned to the positions they occupied as of October 30, 2009, that finding was limited to declaring the Deed of Reconveyance null and void, and reinstating the Deed of Trust, not to a position of forgiven debt as asserted by the Sheets. The Sheets have not presented this court with any authority that would allow this court to disregard the terms of the Note as agreed to by the parties or to support their assertion that they should be excused from complying with their contract obligations for the last four years. As this court has stated on several occasions, the court has sympathy for the Sheets and the frustration they experienced as a result of the failed loan modification in 2009 and this ORDER ON PROPOSED JUDGMENT AND PLAN OF IMPLEMENTATION -5 litigation. the Sheets made strategic throughout the course of litigation that has, in all likelihood, protracted the litigation that was resolved the simple reinstatement of the deed of trust. This court agrees with BofA's position as set forth in the Plaintiffs Supplemental Brief In Support Of Proposed Plan and Entry of Final Judgment. This court does not find that it has the authority to fashion the type of equitable remedy (relieving the Sheets of certain obligations under the terms of the note) as was suggested in paragraph 11 of the Defendant's Response to Court's Request for Legal Authority filed October 1, 2013. The court's authority is limited to the legal conclusions it reached in the FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND ORDER ON PLAINTIFF'S MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT filed April 29, 2013. The court's request in the order that the parties submit a plan for effectuating the order was an effort to encourage the parties' to reach a consensus in the implementation of the court's order and to avoid further stress, inconvenience and legal expense that might result from the acceleration of debt and immediate foreclosure proceedings. The court never intended to suggest that it had the authority to equitably revise the terms of the note or arbitrarily forgive debt. That being said, the Bank of America's suggestions for moving forward appeared to be reasonable but should not be considered binding on either party unless they agree. While the court is fully aware that the genesis of this case was a unilateral mistake made by the Bank of America and its agents, the court also finds that the matter could have been more easily resolved then the extended litigation that resulted in its entry of summary judgment. ON PROPOSED JUDGMENT AND PLAN OF IMPLEMENTATION -6 Conclusion and Order Within fourteen days of this order, the Plaintiff's attorney shall submit to court a proposed Judgment consistent with the court's FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND ORDER ON PLAINTIFF'S MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT filed April 29, 2013 and in compliance with IRCP 54(a). Any request for costs and attorney fees shall be submitted pursuant to applicable Idaho rule, statute or precedent. ,,-\ ~ ""'-..,UJ;Ver C:.. , 2013.

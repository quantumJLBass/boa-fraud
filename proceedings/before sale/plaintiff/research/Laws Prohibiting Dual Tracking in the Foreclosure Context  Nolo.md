> "Dual tracking" occurs when a [mortgage servicer](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/whats-a-mortgage-servicer.html) continues the [foreclosure process](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/foreclosure-basics-terms-parties-steps-and-defenses.html) while simultaneously considering the borrower's application for a [loan modification](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/do-s-and-don-ts-for-getting-a-loan-modification.html) or another [foreclosure avoidance option](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/free-books/foreclosure-book/chapter4-6.html). During the [foreclosure crisis](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/understanding-the-foreclosure-crisis.html), dual tracking was common.

> Now, though, federal law strictly limits the ability of servicers to foreclose on a borrower while also working out a loan modification or other alternative. Some states have enacted similar restrictions.

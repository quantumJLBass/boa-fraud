Often the control is exerted via a majority shareholding, but can be via other mechanisms. It can also be exerted via shareholdings in other companies. When this happens, we call it an indirect subsidiary. Subsidiary information often comes from official annual reports. Companies are only obliged to report 'significant' subsidiaries, and the definition of 'significant' is not consistent." data-html="true" data-original-title="Parent companies" data-placement="right" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" href="" rel="popover">

They sent out a call requesting tenants check there bathroom due to severe weather, water loss etc.

I am responsible so I do and notice an issue. The maintenance main walks in with his shoes, adjusts the pressure on the toilet, fixes the issue. Whole thing takes 2 minutes.

About 2 weeks later I noticed almost 100 charge on this date. When I call to try to work through to the bottom I'm met with lots resistance, eventually supposedly there maintenance man failed to mention he adjusted the flow on my toilet, he actually lied and wrote he did nothing....I'll chalk it up to either forgetful or laziness but now im on the hook for almost 100 $because its a nuisance call..... odd you initiated the response.

So I nicely reached out the front office lady. She seemed to not take any of my objections into consideration and just reference the lease more snarky as we got along. I asked to someone else and I just got told " the owner was just hear and says you have to pay"
And no one is willing to discuss anything until court.

The reputation from town proceeds itself the customer service is poor and they clearly laugh and the idea of being serious. And now I'm being victimized by slumlord tactics.

If you have other options your likely to have better luck there. I didn't even bring up the 5 kids and two adults I have next to me in 2 bedroom on hardwood floor.

WARNING !!!! Stay a way from them.

I selected as my agent online Dec,2023. Paid my $40 Dollars 2-27-2024  plus $5 (don't know transaction fee) Today I called them to make sure my payment was received and they told me everything was good and in 2 minutes they came up with this ". You know what " you have to pay us $40 +$40 2times because you selected us with out our awareness until we were informed by STATE SECRETARY that you have selected us!!!!
They thought I was dumb!  STAY AWAY.

Received a "final bill" with three months of late fees covering two years worth of filings but I never received an initial invoice. Talked to the Owner to try to clear it up but he had no interest of doing the right thing and canceling the late fee. He just kept piling them on until I had no choice but to pay. I would recommend looking elsewhere.

Hours
We are open Monday – Thursday from 9 a.m. – 4 p.m. and Friday from 9 a.m. – Noon except for the following dates:

Important note: All state offices are closed for the state holidays listed below except "Black Friday" which our office will be closed to give our employees an extended thanksgiving weekend.    In addition, with our small staff it may require that our office is closed temporarily throughout the day for staff to assist clients outside of the office and also for lunch and breaks.  During this time an appropriate note will be placed on the exterior door with the appropriate contact information.   It is our hopes that we can have staff in the office Monday – Friday from 9 a.m. – 11 a.m. so that we can make sure we are available during these core hours for Process Servers, with the understanding we should be available during our normal work hours with exceptions as noted.

By law, Zions First National Bank (your present servicer) is usually required to give you at least 15 days notice before the effective date of transfer. Zions First National Bank may have given this notice to you as part of your home loan closing. Countrywide must also send you this notice no later than 15 days after the effective date or at closing.

Finally, we want to make you aware of certain rights you have under RESPA. A summary is provided on the back of this notice. Again, we look forward to having you as a Countrywide customer! SEE REVERSE SIDE FOR IMPORTANT CONSUMER INFORMATION rz! ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS UNDER "RESPA" You should also be aware of your rights as a consumer with a home loan. These are explained in more detail in Section 6 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) (12 U.S.C. 2605). Here are the highlights: During the 60-day period after your first payment is due to Countrywide, if you have already or mistakenly sent a loan paymentto Zions First National Bank before its due date, Countrywide is not allowed to charge you a late fee or treat your payment as late. You have other consumer rights under RESPA Section 6 as well. If you send a `'qualified written request" to Countrywide concerning the servicing of your loan, we must provide you with a written acknowledgement within 20 Business Days of receipt of your request. A `'qualified written request" is a written correspondence which includes your name and account number and your reasons for the request. Writing a note on our payment coupon or envelope is not considered a "qualified written request." lf you wantto send a ''qualified written request", it must be sent to: €ountrywide Home Loans, Attn: Customer Service SVB-314 P0 Box 5170 Simi Valley, CA 93062-5170 Countrywide then has 60 Business Days after receiving your requestto make any appropriate corrections to your account. We must provide you with a written clarification about any dispute. During this 60-Business Day period, we may not provide information to a consumer reporting agency concerning any overdue payment related in any way to your qualified written request. However, this does not prevent us from initiating foreclosure if proper grounds exist under your home loan documents. By definition, a Business Day is a day on which Countrywide.s offices are operl to the public for carrying cn substantially all of Countrywide.s business functions. \ Finally, Section 6 of RESPA also provides for damages and costs for individuals or classes of individuals when servicers are shown to have violated these requirements. You should seek legal advice if you believe your rights have been violated. . Welcome to countrywide! ` SEE REVERSE SIDE FOR IMPORTANT CONSUMER INFORMATION

# Welcome to the Crowd-Sourced Legal Action Project

This is not just a project but a social experiment aimed at creating access to legal help when there are no other choices. We are attempting to crowd-source legal action for the good of the country.

## The Case

In 2008, the financial world was shaken by a crisis that exposed the shady deals made by banks. These institutions cheated and forced the risk onto everyone else and then had the audacity to ask to be saved.

Our main focus is Bank of America (BoA) and its subsidiaries. Between 2008 and 2012, BoA and its parties faced numerous settlements and judgments due to fraudulent activities.

However, they also managed to hide more than we know. That was until a change in our landscape; Covid hit, and then a man at just the right time in life stumbled upon a beacon of fraud begging to be exposed.

This case lays out a massive fraud that was hidden by process, yet BoA has been ever since trying to get any evidence of it neutralized over the years, and it was working too. If you know anything about Wells Fargo and the fake accounts scandal, you will get the scope here. So think Wells Fargo but with home loans. BoA carefully did a form of financial arts and crafts, and it seems thousands of people were taken advantage of.

## It Stops Here

The man who found that fraud has BoA trying to cover it up by foreclosing on him, with the hope it will go away. Well, that man will not lose his home and life savings invested into his home so that BoA can be rewarded for committing the fraud. Instead, this case is using that attempt to take his home to confront and bring BoA to task for their actions. And he needs your help!

This is not just about helping him save his house, but it's about laying the groundwork for sweeping changes to the system for the good of us all. He could take a settlement and let BoA sweep it under the rug, but that means everyone else that has been cheated would not be helped. So he is risking everything because it's the right thing to do, and he knows upon the successful litigation of this case, people will start to see a massive change in our favor, finally, for once in 80 years.

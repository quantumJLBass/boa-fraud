[Mr. Bass 04:59]
Good morning. Good morning. 
[Judge Evans 05:04]
All right, morning. All right. So we are now in session. 
[Judge Evans 05:11]
In the matter of DPW Enterprises LLC and Mountain Prime 2018 LLC versus Jeremy Bass and Dwayne Pike, this is case number CV35-24-1063. This matter is set for a few different issues. 
[Judge Evans 05:31]
Because originally I think except for a status conference pertaining to plaintiff versus Mr. Pike and then there was a motion filed by the plaintiff for attorney's fees regarding Mr. Bass. 
[Judge Evans 05:43]
Mr. Bass in turn filed 2 motions, 1A motion to stay, and the second, a motion to waive the supersedious bond. All of these those 3 motions are scheduled for hearing this morning. 
[Judge Evans 05:58]
So, uh, let's take up one, uh, let's take first take up the motion for attorney's fees. Uh, Mr. Stoddard, uh, thank. 
[Mr. Stoddard 06:07]
Your Honor, as the Court's aware, this case centered around an action for possession of real property following a non judicial foreclosure sale. 
[Mr. Stoddard 06:16]
Mr. Bass has appeared and contested that, resulting in my client having to file for summary judgment and to respond to a number of additional motions. In total, as of the date of seeking entry of judgment against Mr. Bass following the court's granting of summary judgment against him, my client has incurred close to $10,000 in attorneys fees in dealing with his various pleadings. 
[Mr. Stoddard 06:45]
Because we are the prevailing party, I believe that it's appropriate for an award of those attorneys fees. Additionally, I want to bring to light, and I think this will become not only a a argument in opposition to the motion to stay in waiver of the supersedious bond, but Mr. Bass's most recent pleadings contradict. 
[Mr. Stoddard 07:11]
The proceedings up until now. 
[Mr. Stoddard 07:13]
Specifically, Mr. Bass in his most recent affidavit. 
[Mr. Stoddard 07:19]
As well as the supporting affidavit he just recently filed by the court indicate he's not even living in the property. According to the affidavit of Melissa Gunch, he is residing at a different piece of property, which is contrary to his answer in this matter where he swore underoath that he was occupying the property if Mr. Bass isn't in the property. 
[Mr. Stoddard 07:43]
We aren't here. My client wouldn't have had to incur the attorneys fees and cost for seeking to eject him because he doesn't need to be ejected. 
[Mr. Stoddard 07:54]
So what we have, your Honor, is. 
[Mr. Stoddard 07:58]
Over $10,000 of attorney fees that have been racked up all while under the guise of Mr. Bass's representation of this court that he is occupying the property. He is a resident of the property and now in order to request to stay and or waiver of a supersedious bond. 
[Mr. Stoddard 08:15]
He achieves that position to say that the in writing that the property is uninhabitable and turns out he, according to the affidavit of Mrs. Gunch, has been residing in a different property since February of 2024, before this suit was ever initiated. So with those, Your Honor, I believe that an award of attorney fees is appropriate both as prevailing party. 
[Mr. Stoddard 08:40]
And I think under 12120 where defense of the matter has been pursued frivolously. 
[Mr. Stoddard 08:47]
The law with respect to the impact of a trustees deed in favor of a good faith purchaser for value says that it is conclusive. Again, my clients racked up $10,000 in attorneys fees all under the guise of Mr. Bass is occupying or residing in the property which is recent filings indicate has been. It is false and has been false for the entirety of this underlying lawsuit. So. 
[Mr. Stoddard 09:14]
At this point, we would request that the court. 
[Mr. Stoddard 09:17]
Amend the judgment to award my client its attorney season costs in pursuing the claims against Mr. Bass. Thank you. 
[Judge Evans 09:29]
Thank you. 
[Judge Evans 09:31]
Before we proceed further, Mr. Nagy, I just noticed that Mister Pike's audio is not connected. Did you want to? So he hasn't been able to, uh, listen or partake so far in this hearing. 
[Mr. Stoddard 09:46]
I'm sorry, Ron, Ron, I'm in a different location than he is. 
[Judge Evans 09:49]
OK. 
[Judge Evans 09:51]
I don't know how it has to resolve that issue then. 
[Mr. Nagy 09:56]
Well, I can call my office and see if they can work on it. So I'll mute myself and and get them working on it. Your honor, I appreciate you pointing that out. 
[Judge Evans 10:05]
Alright, thank you. Then, uh, continuing on with the motion for attorney's fees, uh, Mr. Bass? 
[Mr. Bass 10:13]
Yes, thank you, Your Honor. 
[Mr. Bass 10:16]
The attorney fees, any request for that. 
[Mr. Bass 10:20]
It would seem to be. 
[Mr. Bass 10:26]
Would be. 
[Mr. Bass 10:29]
Early to be done. As far as my residence of the property. My property, my stuff is at the property. Just because I can't take a shower there and lay my head there doesn't mean that I don't have property there and that it's not. This isn't my property where I would normally live at. 
[Mr. Bass 10:50]
The point that was made before which I had said. 
[Mr. Bass 10:56]
In the last hearing was that I had no water or anything, uh, to be able to stay and lay there, but that doesn't mean that my property is not there. So I haven't been disingenuous at all about the fact that this is, this is where my home is and this is where my property. I'm just having to pay rent since it was, uh, said that I wasn't paying rent or anything of that nature, that I was basically living Scott free. 
[Mr. Bass 11:22]
Off, uh, their dime, uh, it, I figured it was important to go ahead and, and show that, yes, I was actually paying rent for some place that I could take my shower and, uh, lay my head and store some of my stuff to protect my property. 
[Mr. Bass 11:37]
Umm, so I haven't been disingenuous at all in that nature. Uh, in fact, uh, the plaintiffs, uh, and the law firm, uh, they have actually in, in multiple, uh, cases that are through the courts that are active right now, umm, all their trustee deeds, uh, which I can list off the courts, the names of them or the docket numbers and. 
[Mr. Bass 12:05]
Uh, which filings they would be? 
[Mr. Bass 12:08]
Uh, but there's a handful of them where they're, the law firm is acting as the trustees and the plaintiff is the buyers. And, uh, they have conflict of interest there. And The thing is, is that in Utah, that would be a, that's a problem for those cases there, but it shows that they're not being genuine in their own right, uh, or being on the up and up. I'm coming from a. 
[Mr. Bass 12:38]
So if I'm trying to protect my home, the place I've had for the last 20 years, uh, so I would hardly say that it's frivolous to try to protect that. I didn't go into default because I didn't make my payments. I went into default, uh, in a forbearance that was to try to figure out what was prom, what was the wrong with the papers. So it, it, I, I didn't want to be here. And even when I tried to solve it, uh, I put. 
[Mr. Bass 13:08]
Good faith effort into to doing that and it's not gone great for me, but I hardly say that it's it's not within my rights to protect my property. 
[Mr. Bass 13:24]
And I've done so with good faith at every step of the way. But I haven't necessarily. 
[Mr. Bass 13:35]
Done the best job that I could, but. 
[Mr. Bass 13:38]
The mischaracterizations of renting, sorry, me living rent free, that I'm not that there, uh, they're taking harm and I'm, uh, uh, profiting off of it. Uh, it's just not the case. And because we're, there's still things that are, are. 
[Mr. Bass 14:04]
Uh, moving forward any kind of of award of, of attorney fees would be premature. 
[Mr. Bass 14:13]
Is what I would put out there. 
[Judge Evans 14:16]
Alright, thank you. 
[Judge Evans 14:19]
Thank you for the issue of attorneys fees. I will take the matter and advisement. I'll issue a decision in due course. Let's move on then to Mr. Yes. 
[Mr. Nagy 14:30]
Can I have some input on the attorney fee issue 'cause it does affect my client slightly? 
[Mr. Nagy 14:34]
Alright. 
[Mr. Nagy 14:37]
I, I, I apologize, Your Honor, I just wanted to respond to the Mr. Sutter's interesting argument that Mister Bass is not occupying the property. In fact, Mr. Bass's tenant, my client, is occupying the property. He resides there. And so I think that it does have, I would argue that Mister Bass has not made a material misstatement of fact. 
[Mr. Nagy 15:02]
And as Mr. Bass has stated, his possessions are at the property. And however, also Mr. Stoddard has argued that his client is a prevailing party. And I know you're honored you have entered your order. 
[Mr. Nagy 15:19]
Essentially declaring that Mister Stoddard's client has prevailed in this proceeding against Mr. Bass. However, Mr. Bass has appealed it and he's asking for the stay. Therefore, I would question whether in fact, at this stage in the proceeding, Mr. Stoddard's client is in fact. 
[Mr. Nagy 15:40]
Preventing party while that appeal is pending. Thank you, your honor. 
[Judge Evans 15:51]
Alright, thank you again. I will take the issue of attorney fees as requested by the plaintiff against Mr. Bass under advisement and I'll issue a decision in due course. Let's move on to Mr. Bass's motion, uh, to stay and if the corresponding motion to waive supersede bonds. So Mr. Bass, I'd be glad to hear from you. 
[Mr. Bass 16:10]
Uh yeah. Umm. The motion to stay, Uh. 
[Mr. Bass 16:17]
Is to protect the status quo of where we're at. 
[Mr. Bass 16:22]
The least amount of harm to anyone, all parties involved, is to continue to stay as it is. 
[Mr. Bass 16:32]
Any loss of property on my side would be irreparable. There'd be no way for me to to make that whole again, unlike their side where they do have a way to make themselves monetarily whole again. So if I prevail, then they. 
[Mr. Bass 16:53]
Have a monetary means to go back and become whole. If I lose then I have no way to to make myself whole. I have no one to go after but. 
[Mr. Bass 17:06]
I uh, the least amount of disruption to the current situation is to, uh, wait until everything is played its course. Umm, I'm doing what I'm. 
[Mr. Bass 17:22]
I believe I'm supposed to, as far as protecting my, my rights for my property. And in that process, uh, I, uh, am exercising all rights to, uh, justice that I can get. Umm, And so I do believe that it's, uh, it's for the best interest of public interest to, you know, believe in the system, uh, as well as least amount of harm for us, for all of us involved. 
[Mr. Bass 17:51]
Umm, and the fact that there's really no. 
[Mr. Bass 17:54]
Uh, no immediate harm, uh, or immediate gain by, uh, shifting to another position from here. 
[Mr. Bass 18:05]
Uh, that would be for, uh, what I would say for the stay itself, umm, uh, would. Should I go over the bond, Your honor? Yes, please. OK, sorry. As far as the bond goes. 
[Mr. Bass 18:23]
As everything I understand about the bond is to protect the prevailing party from costs and damage since they if they were to go ahead and win if I was to fail at the. 
[Mr. Bass 18:39]
The appeal process then they would still get the property, they would not be out anything there. They would just have their, uh, lawyer fees if they were to win that umm, and with that said, I've put out uh, to maintain uh, Mr. Pike's rights, uh, and keep him, uh, protected, uh, for his lease and everything uh, paying the, the bills and. 
[Mr. Bass 19:07]
At my own cost. I'm not making a profit as it has been presented before and I'm actually doing at a loss. 
[Mr. Bass 19:20]
But making sure that I take care of the property rights and everything, I've only improved it since we started, since February, even though I haven't tried to to rectify the water thing 'cause that too much. 
[Mr. Bass 19:37]
Putting in we're just exacerbate the problem if there was a loss, but I have to incur, you know the rent that I have to somewhere to sleep and everything I have to protect all my property. These are these are are the losses that I would see if if I was to win and. 
[Mr. Bass 20:04]
That's not getting covered. I I would basically ask. 
[Mr. Bass 20:08]
If it's assumed that I was genuine, that this there was a problem and I'm and I'm getting a fraud that's put against me and I'm just not doing it right to protect myself. 
[Mr. Bass 20:23]
I have all the equity of all those years in there. That equity should mean something. And I know that they're saying they've got their 150 that they put down to purchase the place, but I have my 100 and. 
[Mr. Bass 20:38]
Uh, plus there too. And I would argue that their money is no more valuable than my, uh, investment in, and this is my, my home, my, uh, where my retirement is put in, uh, what I can give to my kids. Uh, you know, everything I've put into here is this is my place. 
[Mr. Bass 21:03]
So the losses are greater on my side. If any kind of bond was, uh, to be put there, it'd be uh. 
[Mr. Bass 21:12]
Almost punitive in nature because it's it's just trying to prevent me from seeking a appeal and put up roadblocks in the way. 
[Mr. Bass 21:23]
That's. 
[Mr. Bass 21:26]
It it it it it doesn't help preserve the justice by putting those roadblocks up. 
[Mr. Bass 21:37]
Yeah. 
[Mr. Bass 21:39]
I I believe that's that's. 
[Mr. Bass 21:43]
What I have to say there? 
[Judge Evans 21:45]
Alright, thank you, Mr. Bass. 
[Mr. Bass 21:48]
Thank you, Your honor. 
[Judge Evans 21:49]
Mr. Staughter, did you want to respond on the motion pertaining to the stay as well as the motion pertaining to the superstitious vote? 
[Mr. Stoddard 21:57]
I would, Your Honor, I, I think it's important to recognize the procedural posture of this case and the claims that are actually before the court. 
[Mr. Stoddard 22:06]
Any equity that Mister Bass had in that property he lost. When it went to foreclosure sale, it was gone. The claim before the court is for possession of the property. There is no claim to set aside the trustees sale. There is no claim for damages but that Mister Bass is asserting against the trustee or his former lender. None of that has occurred. This Court has determined that my client, pursuant to a trustee's deed, is entitled to possession and that is the only issue. 
[Mr. Stoddard 22:36]
That is before the court and then they only issue that is on appeal. Again, contrary to Mr. Nagy's comments, I'll go ahead and lay forth the procedural history on this one. On August 14th of 2024, Plata file this complaint and in it alleged a paragraph 3. 
[Mr. Stoddard 22:58]
Or I guess it was on August 14th when the complaint was filed. Plaintiff alleged that the defendants, including Mr. Bass, were occupying and refusing to surrender the property. 
[Mr. Stoddard 23:07]
On August 14th, Mr. Bass filed his response to summons and complaint which at paragraph 3 stated defendant admits to occupying the property October 15th of 2024. When Mr. Bass responded to the summary judgment motion, he again alleged that defendant is the owner and resident of the property on November 6th of 2024 when he made his first stay motion. 
[Mr. Stoddard 23:33]
He alleged that without a stay, defendant will face immediate eviction. 
[Mr. Stoddard 23:38]
Removal of his person from that property. 
[Mr. Stoddard 23:42]
In his affidavit and supported that motion for stay, he maintained that his primary residence is the property. In his memorandum in support of the motion for stay, he alleged that absent a stay, immediate eviction from his primary residence would result in the loss of his home. Now, in his most recent filings, again, he is represented in this court and submitted an affidavit. 
[Mr. Stoddard 24:08]
That indicates that paragraph 2A, since February of 2024, Mr. Bass has resided at an entirely different piece of property pursuant to some sort of rental arrangement. 
[Mr. Stoddard 24:22]
Now, As for Mr. Pike, that's a that's a different story for a different day. That's not before the court. That is still an active issue to be litigated. The impact of the judgment against Mr. Bass has no implication or impact on Mr. Pike's rights. In fact, we're out here for a status conference to determine those with that preceding background in mind. 
[Mr. Stoddard 24:44]
Mr. Bass's request for stay is to prevent his eviction from a property that he has now admitted in his filings he's not residing at. And so that coupled with the statutory framework that clearly provides that a trustee's deed is final and conclusive in for a good faith purchaser and that any defects in notice. 
[Mr. Stoddard 25:09]
Are waived where a party has actual notice of the sale, which Mr. Bass did. 
[Mr. Stoddard 25:14]
All support that there is no basis for Mr. Bass's appeal. Certainly he has the right to appeal. Certainly we may move to dismiss that appeal and I'm being moved because he's not in possession of the property. But he's presented no valid basis for a a stay in this matter. And certainly his recent filings contradict his underlying assertion that without a state, he faces immediate removal from that property because he's not actually there. He might be using it as a storage. 
[Mr. Stoddard 25:44]
Which it sounds like based on its testimony today is, is the only quote UN quote occupation of that property. But he's not facing eviction where he admits he's living someplace else. With respect to the Super serious bond. Again, your Honor, Mr. Bass has not sought to set aside the underlying sale. He has not sued the trustee. He has not sued his his lender. 
[Mr. Stoddard 26:09]
Where he comes up with the theory that my clients entitled to go back and be be made whole. 
[Mr. Stoddard 26:14]
I have no idea what the basis of that is. My client is out over $160,000 in money that it paid over a year ago. Since that time it has been denied possession of the property. Obviously, you know Mr. Pike's rental of a basement unit, it's a, it's a separate issue, but with respect to the remainder of the property, my client has been denied possession and the ability to use that property. 
[Mr. Stoddard 26:43]
As the recorded owner of record, my client has to pay the property taxes, has to keep that insured that Mister Bass is, I guess, deciding to keep his belongings warm and and by storing them there. I think it has no basis on whether or not a stay is warranted in this matter. Mr. Pike, meanwhile, again different story for a different day, is able to contact the owner of this property and Mr. Nagy and I have. 
[Mr. Stoddard 27:13]
Are are openly discussing that? 
[Mr. Stoddard 27:15]
And can deal with that. So the fact that Mister Bass, I guess is guiding to pay, pay bills on a property he doesn't live in or to help support a occupant in the basement for who he's not responsible for, do not support waiver of a bond in this matter. And for those reasons, 1 based on the admission that he's not residing in that property. 
[Mr. Stoddard 27:42]
I think any type of stay is unwarranted because he doesn't face the purported harms that he is alleged. Specifically, he doesn't face immediate removal. He's already out. 
[Mr. Stoddard 27:53]
And secondly, if the court issues a stay, the law cited in in our briefing indicates that a bond should be required at a minimum for the last use of that property for my client and and Mr. Bass has proposed no, no bond whatsoever simply wants wants it waived altogether. We've provided the court with a number of different. 
[Mr. Stoddard 28:18]
Tax that other District Court judges have taken and similar actions that I've handled throughout the state. 
[Mr. Stoddard 28:25]
Those include everything from outright denial of a state where there's no merit to the appeal, to the posting of a bond in an amount of the purchase price of the property, or the posting of a bond and an amount consistent with the tax assessed value at 20%. I think all of those should the court determine that a stay is appropriate. 
[Mr. Stoddard 28:52]
Would be a warranted precondition of any sort of stay in this matter. Thank you. 
[Judge Evans 28:59]
Thank you. Mr. Naggy, is there anything you wanted to add in regards to these, uh, last two motions regarding the stay and the bond? 
[Mr. Nagy 29:06]
Yes, your honor, thank you. Umm, your Honor. Uh, Mr. Stoddard, I think has mixed together his, uh, reply to my comments with regards to the attorneys fees into his argument for the stay. I think that they're separate issues, uh, and I don't see whether Mr. Bass is currently occupying or residing at the premises. 
[Mr. Nagy 29:29]
Or not to necessarily be an issue with regards to the motion for the stay. 
[Mr. Nagy 29:39]
I didn't. I understood this to be a motion hearing. Mr. Stoddard seems to be wanting to argue evidence at this hearing. And I think that I'm going to restate what I've heard from Mr. Bass because I think Mr. Bass made a very logical and sound argument. 
[Mr. Nagy 29:59]
But he didn't make it in the typical way that attorneys would argue it. And what I'm hearing from Mr. Bass is that, Your Honor, if you don't stay the enforcement of your order while the appeal is pending, he will be irrevocably deprived of a property right because Mr. Stoddard's client will take possession of the property. Of course, that will potentially have an effect on my client as well. 
[Mr. Nagy 30:28]
And so he, he will not be able to be made whole if he prevails on appeal, he will have lost possession of the premises. And there would be no way to repair that situation if the appellate court agrees with Mr. Bass's arguments that the, uh, foreclosure on his property was faulty. So. 
[Mr. Nagy 30:53]
I do believe that Mister Bass's arguments are warranted. What that the matter should be stayed. 
[Mr. Nagy 31:00]
Not only because my client would benefit from that as well, but because. 
[Mr. Nagy 31:07]
Both parties, my client and Mr. Bass would be. 
[Mr. Nagy 31:12]
Damaged by allowing Mr. Stoddard's clients to take possession before the appeal is heard. So I do think it makes sense to stay the proceeding. I, I won't speak to the the bond because my client does not have a position on that. 
[Mr. Nagy 31:30]
But I will state finally that I assume the court will be taking up the status conference. 
[Mr. Nagy 31:37]
Afterwards and in the event, and I'll be asking the court to hold off scheduling anything until the court has had an opportunity to decide whether it will be granting the stay or not because that will affect whether we'll be going forward on Mr. Pike's part of the case. Thank you, your Honor. 
[Judge Evans 31:57]
Alright, thank you. 
[Judge Evans 32:03]
Well. 
[Mr. Stoddard 32:05]
Can I quickly respond to Mr. Naggy's a couple of comments? Your Honor, You may thank you. First off, there's nothing in the record indicating that Mister Pike suffers any type of harm by virtue of a ruling against Mr. Bass and removal of Mr. Bass from the property. Second, the question before the court is whether a stage should prevent Mr. Bass's removal from the property, not Mr. Pike's. 
[Mr. Stoddard 32:32]
Mr. Pike's issue, because court issued A54B certificate, means that those issues still can continue to be decided by the court. 
[Mr. Stoddard 32:40]
And continue to be litigated. The spike resides there. Mr. Pike claims he has a lease. Mr. Pike claims that he is paying rent. Those are all issues that that the court will decide as this matter continues forward. Any stay for Mr. Bass preventing his removal does not stay. 
[Mr. Stoddard 32:59]
A determination as to Mr. Pike's entitlement to continue to reside in the property and with whether or not Mr. Pike should be removed from that property. 
[Mr. Stoddard 33:09]
He still has his day in court. He still is not facing immediate eviction or any damages whatsoever, which is the reason why we effectively bifurcated these two issues. 
[Mr. Stoddard 33:25]
That is my only comment, your Honor. All right. 
[Judge Evans 33:27]
Thank you. 
[Mr. Bass 33:32]
Is there? May I make any comments, your honor? 
[Judge Evans 33:35]
You may, Mr. Beth. 
[Mr. Bass 33:37]
I would just want to add that. 
[Mr. Bass 33:42]
Having my property like my truck that is immobile, those are things that I do have at the property and and why it's. 
[Mr. Bass 33:55]
I don't see it as disingenuous or me trying to lie at all to say that I am. 
[Mr. Bass 34:02]
That have property there and that it's it's occupying the area. 
[Mr. Bass 34:08]
Me needing to have a place to take a shower and feed myself is an extra burden that I have to have because of the situation. And if it, if the situation wasn't happening, I wouldn't have to be doing this. I would also, uh, had taken care of, uh, my ability to, you know, have water and, and, uh, sanitary needs, but. 
[Mr. Bass 34:34]
That doesn't change that my I have things like my truck, things that I can't just put at someone else's place easily and so that harm. 
[Mr. Bass 34:45]
It comes in multiple, in multiple ways with me, and that's part of the reason why a stay is the most neutral path that I can see while I exercise my rights to an appeal. 
[Mr. Bass 35:02]
And I believe his the most neutral of options. And I did wanted to point out that I did offer a nominal bond amount in in one of the motions. I hadn't just said, you know, Willy nilly. 
[Mr. Bass 35:22]
That everything should be free. 
[Mr. Bass 35:26]
Although I do take a very heavy hit in in this process and and and fronting things while I have income taken away and covering things that should be for the property. But I did offer a a nominal bond that wouldn't be hard to to. 
[Mr. Bass 35:51]
To. 
[Mr. Bass 35:52]
Put out and and show good faith with but I I didn't want to. 
[Mr. Bass 36:00]
Not or I don't want to point out that I had made an offer that was a nominal 1. So with that, that's all I would have to add, Your Honor. 
[Judge Evans 36:11]
Alright, thank you. 
[Judge Evans 36:12]
Thank you. 
[Judge Evans 36:15]
I am gonna take this issue in regards to the motion to stay and the motion regarding the Super CDs bond under advisement. I will issue try to get a decision issued out uh, in due course, hopefully shortly. Umm, given that uh, Mr. Nag, you indicated that since I'm not uh, prepared to uh rule on, on the on the record today, umm, a status conference pertaining to the keys regarding Mr. Pike. 
[Judge Evans 36:42]
Perhaps should be continued. 
[Judge Evans 36:44]
So that we know where we're headed. Is that what I? Is that what you indicated? 
[Mr. Nagy 36:49]
I, I, it does make sense to me, your Honor, to do that, given that we don't know at this point. 
[Mr. Nagy 36:57]
Whether the eviction will be going forward in order to correct, I think a misstatement of procedure that Mister Stoddard made. He stated that Mister, my client would not be deprived of a property right if his client took possession. Well, Your Honor, Mr. Bass, my understanding is has never alleged that my client is in default. 
[Mr. Nagy 37:17]
And should be evicted. Therefore, if Mr. Stoddard's clients take possession of the property, they then can proceed with the eviction proceeding against my client. Whereas if the appellate court agrees with Mr. Bass and he retains ownership of the property, then presumably Mr. Bass would not be proceeding with the eviction against my client because he's never alleged that my clients in default. So at this point, given the. 
[Mr. Nagy 37:43]
The, uh, kind of the muddle that we're in here. 
[Mr. Nagy 37:48]
Not knowing the. 
[Mr. Nagy 37:51]
Whether Mr. Bass will be granted the relief that he's seeking in the appeal, it would make sense to me to hold off doing a status conference and schedule scheduling something in the unlawful detainer proceeding. 
[Judge Evans 38:07]
Mr. Starter, do you have any objection to his bumping out this status conference for a couple weeks? 
[Mr. Stoddard 38:13]
If it's a couple of weeks, no, Your Honor, but again, I, I, I think procedurally Mr. Nagy's mistaken. Mr. Pike filed his answer in this matter, not alleging that he's paying the rightful owner, not alleging that Mister Bass owns the property, but alleging that he's not subject to eviction because he has a lease agreement that under the Protecting Tenants of Foreclosure Act has to be honored by my clients. 
[Mr. Stoddard 38:42]
For the end of its term, so. 
[Mr. Stoddard 38:46]
If he wants it honored, then the question before the court based on the pleadings, specifically Mr. Pikes verified answer is whether or not he has a valid bona fide lease and whether or not he's in compliance with that if he wants to invoke that as a means of avoiding my clients request for possession. That being the case again, if Mr. Bass is evicted. 
[Mr. Stoddard 39:11]
Mr. Pike still gets his day in court. We still get to litigate over whether or not his lease is bona fide, whether or not he's in compliance with that lease. 
[Mr. Stoddard 39:20]
Et cetera. 
[Mr. Stoddard 39:23]
An appeal by Mr. Bass has no implication on that, especially where Mr. Pike has not alleged otherwise. Mr. Pike is not alleging a challenge to ownership of this property. He is only alleged that his lease, my client is required to honor. And so that's the matter that proceeds forward. I think Mr. Nagy is correct. He does potentially face eviction for non payment of rent because he continues to pay the wrong party. But again, those aren't issues for this court. Those are issues to be. 
[Mr. Stoddard 39:53]
Continue to be litigated and because this court issued A54B certificate on the judgment against Mr. Bass, those are claims that can continue to be litigated through the normal course of of these proceedings. So if if it's just a two week continuance to see where the court comes down on the stay, that's fine. But again, given the procedure procedural posture of the case, what's been alleged in the complaint, which was alleged in Mr. Pike's verified answer, whether the court stays removal of Mr. 
[Mr. Stoddard 40:23]
*** has no implication on whether or not Mr. Pike has a separate right to continue to occupy the property under a lease agreement and whether or not he is in compliance with that lease agreement. Thank you. 
[Judge Evans 40:37]
Thank you. And I do have to apologize. I can't actually. I will not have an answer in a week and in two weeks I will be in a criminal jury trial. So I would next be available 3 weeks out, which would be on February 11. 
[Judge Evans 40:55]
Is that February 11? I would be able to hear it at 930. Does that work? 
[Judge Evans 41:03]
With Mr. Nagy, with you and your client and Mr. Staughter. 
[Mr. Stoddard 41:08]
That works for me, Your Honor. 
[Mr. Stoddard 41:11]
Alright. 
[Mr. Nagy 41:12]
So I will have an answer. 
[Mr. Nagy 41:16]
My grandmother. OK, I'm trying to get my calendar open here. No problem. 
[Judge Evans 41:23]
I hear papers that sounds like an old fashioned calendar. 
[Mr. Nagy 41:26]
Well, I, I, my camera wouldn't work when I first joined the hearing today and it told me close my browser and reopen it. And so I did that. When I did that, I shut off my electronic calendar. That's it. 
[Mr. Nagy 41:40]
February 11th. At what time? 
[Judge Evans 41:41]
Your Honor at 9:30, if that's available. 
[Mr. Nagy 41:44]
Yes, your Honor. 
[Judge Evans 41:45]
Alright. Then I'll go ahead and set a status conference pertaining to plaintiff versus Mr. Pike on February 11th at 9:30. And then Mr. Bass, I'll get out a decision pertaining to whether this matter, the enforcement of the summer judgment will be stayed or not. And if not? 
[Judge Evans 42:07]
Or if so, whether or not there will be a requirement for a super CDs bond? 
[Judge Evans 42:13]
And then I assume you'll be pursuing your appeal up at the upper level? 
[Mr. Bass 42:17]
Yes, your Honor. 
[Mr. Stoddard 42:18]
Alright, anything further in regards to this case today? 
[Mr. Stoddard 42:24]
I complain of your honor. 
[Mr. Bass 42:25]
Not complaining, thank. 
[Judge Evans 42:28]
You all have a great, great day. Thank. 
[Mr. Bass 42:30]
You, Your honor. 
[Mr. Bass 42:47]
3/17/82 is my birthday. It's 2020 5/01/21. 
[Mr. Bass 42:58]
Is 10:38 AM Pacific Standard Time. 
[Mr. Bass 43:05]
I didn't follow my notes well enough. It makes me so nervous in here. I screw up. I choke up. 
[Mr. Bass 43:15]
I think Mr. Nege.

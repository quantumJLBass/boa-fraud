### **1. Challenge Plaintiffs' Bona Fide Purchaser Status**

The core of the Plaintiffs' case is their claim to be **bona fide purchasers** under **Idaho Code § 45-1508**. If we successfully dismantle this claim, their **ownership** and **right to possession** collapse, which is the foundation of their case for evicting both Mr. Bass and Mr. Pike. Here's the revised strategy.

---

#### **A. The Foreclosure Sale Should Not Have Occurred Due to a Binding Pre-Sale Agreement**

**Argument**:  
The foreclosure sale on **February 29, 2024** was **unlawful** because **Mr. Bass had already entered into a binding verbal agreement** with the mortgage servicer, **Carrington Mortgage**, to **pay off the loan** in full. Under Idaho law, verbal contracts related to real estate are **valid and enforceable** when **part performance** demonstrates the existence of the agreement. Here, **Mr. Bass’s payment of taxes and insurance** is proof of the **execution of this pre-sale agreement**. Despite this, Carrington proceeded with the foreclosure sale, violating both **the agreement** and Idaho law.

- **Key Points**:
    
    - The agreement to **pay off the mortgage** had already been reached and executed by **Mr. Bass**, who had paid the taxes and insurance on the property as part of the agreement.
    - **No ongoing negotiations** were taking place because the agreement was already binding. The Trustee’s action in moving forward with the sale was improper and done in bad faith.
- **Supporting Evidence**:
    
    - **Proof of payment** for taxes and insurance by Mr. Bass as part of the pre-sale agreement.
    - **Affidavit of Mr. Bass**, attesting to the details of the pre-sale agreement and the Trustee’s knowledge of it.
- **Case Law**:
    
    - **Taylor v. Just, 138 Idaho 137 (2002)**: The **Idaho Supreme Court voided a trustee’s sale** because the grantor and beneficiary had entered into a **pre-sale agreement** that resolved the default, making the sale unnecessary. Similarly, the pre-sale agreement between Mr. Bass and the mortgage servicer **cured the default**, and the Trustee’s sale proceeded improperly.
    - **Federal National Mortgage Ass’n v. Hafer, 158 Idaho 694 (2015)**: The court voided a trustee's sale because the default had been resolved before foreclosure, rendering the sale unauthorized under Idaho law. The facts here are similar, as Mr. Bass had resolved the default.
    - **Security Pacific Finance Corp. v. Bishop, 109 Idaho 25 (1985)**: This case established that procedural defects in the non-judicial foreclosure process, such as moving forward despite a cured default, invalidate the sale. The procedural defect here was the Trustee's disregard of the agreement between Mr. Bass and the mortgage servicer.
- **Legal Doctrine: Promissory Estoppel**:
    
    - **Promissory estoppel** prevents a party from reneging on a promise when the other party has reasonably relied on it to their detriment. Mr. Bass reasonably relied on the agreement with Carrington Mortgage, performing his part by paying the taxes and insurance, which makes the foreclosure sale unjustifiable.
- **Legal Basis**:  
    Under **Idaho law**, the Trustee's sale is void because the **default had been cured** through the pre-sale agreement, as seen in the cases cited. Since the sale should never have occurred, the Plaintiffs cannot claim **bona fide purchaser status**, as they purchased the property in violation of a pre-existing agreement.

#### **B. Foreclosure Was Conducted Using the Wrong Instrument**

**Argument**:  
The foreclosure sale was **invalid** because **Carrington Mortgage** initiated the foreclosure based on an **incorrect instrument**. The servicing company admitted to the **Idaho Department of Finance** that the instrument used was not the one that should have been foreclosed on. This significant procedural error renders the foreclosure **legally void**.

- **Key Points**:
    
    - **Carrington Mortgage** used an incorrect Deed of Trust to foreclose, despite admitting to the Idaho Department of Finance that another instrument should have been used.
    - This procedural defect invalidates the entire foreclosure process, making the subsequent Trustee's sale invalid.
- **Supporting Evidence**:
    
    - **Documents from Carrington Mortgage** admitting to the Idaho Department of Finance that the wrong instrument was used.
    - **Correspondence with the Idaho Department of Finance**, confirming the error in the foreclosure instrument.
- **Legal Basis**:
    
    - Under **Idaho Code § 45-1508**, a sale conducted using the wrong instrument is **void**. The Idaho Supreme Court has held that when there are **procedural defects** in the foreclosure process, the sale must be set aside (**Security Pacific Finance Corp. v. Bishop, 109 Idaho 25 (1985)**). Since the wrong instrument was used, the Plaintiffs cannot claim bona fide purchaser status.

---

#### **C. The Trustee’s Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Bad Faith**

**Argument**:  
The Trustee breached their **fiduciary duty** by proceeding with the sale despite the **pre-existing agreement** that cured the default. The Trustee’s **duty of good faith** to both the lender and the borrower required them to postpone the sale in light of the agreement. Proceeding with the sale was a clear violation of this duty.

- **Key Points**:
    
    - The Trustee was fully aware of the **binding agreement** between Mr. Bass and Carrington Mortgage.
    - By proceeding with the foreclosure sale, the Trustee acted in bad faith, violating their fiduciary duty.
- **Supporting Evidence**:
    
    - **Affidavit of Mr. Bass**, detailing communications with the Trustee and their awareness of the payoff agreement.
    - **Documents or correspondence** showing that Carrington Mortgage and the Trustee knew about the agreement to cure the default.
- **Legal Basis**:
    
    - **Idaho Code § 45-1506** requires that a Trustee act in **good faith** when conducting a foreclosure sale. A **breach of fiduciary duty** can invalidate the sale, as seen in **Renz v. Wells Fargo Bank**. Since the Trustee knowingly disregarded the payoff agreement, the sale is invalid, and the Plaintiffs cannot be considered bona fide purchasers.

---

#### **D. Knowledge of Title Defects (Plaintiffs Not Bona Fide Purchasers)**

**Argument**:  
The Plaintiffs were fully aware of **defects in the title** and the ongoing dispute over the foreclosure. **Mr. Bass** made it publicly known at the auction that the sale was **rigged** and disputed. Additionally, a **poster had been displayed** in the window of the property for two years, detailing the ongoing legal issues. Given this **actual and constructive knowledge**, the Plaintiffs cannot claim to have acted in **good faith**.

- **Key Points**:
    
    - **Public Notice**: Mr. Bass’s public display at the auction and the poster in the window of the property provided **clear notice** to the Plaintiffs that the sale was disputed.
    - **Constructive Knowledge**: The Plaintiffs cannot claim ignorance of the legal issues when they had access to this information.
- **Supporting Evidence**:
    
    - **Photos of the Sign and Poster**: Showing that the Plaintiffs were informed of the dispute.
    - **Affidavit of Mr. Bass**: Attesting to the fact that the sale was contested and that this was made publicly known.
- **Legal Basis**:
    
    - Under **Idaho Code § 45-1508**, a purchaser with **actual knowledge of defects** in the title cannot claim to be a **bona fide purchaser**. The Plaintiffs had both actual and constructive knowledge of the disputed sale, making their claim to ownership invalid.

---

### **2. Procedural Defects in Foreclosure and Eviction**

Even if the court disregards the challenge to **bona fide purchaser status**, the Plaintiffs' case is still fatally flawed by significant **procedural defects** in both the foreclosure and eviction processes. These defects invalidate their right to possession.

---

#### **A. Invalid Eviction Notices**

**Argument**:  
The **eviction notices** served on both **Mr. Bass** and **Mr. Pike** were **legally defective**. The notices referenced an attached deed, which was never provided, leaving the recipients without sufficient information to understand the basis for the eviction.

- **Key Points**:
    
    - **Incomplete Notices**: The eviction notices were incomplete because they referenced a document (the deed) that was never attached.
    - **Legally Insufficient**: Without providing all required documentation, the notices are **invalid under Idaho law**.
- **Supporting Evidence**:
    
    - **Copies of the Eviction Notices**: Showing the missing attachments.
    - **Affidavits of Mr. Bass and Mr. Pike**: Confirming that the referenced deed was never included with the notice.
- **Legal Basis**:
    
    - Under **Idaho Code § 6-303**, an eviction notice must be complete and provide all required documentation. A **defective notice** is insufficient to support an eviction. Since the notices were incomplete, the Plaintiffs cannot proceed with the eviction.

---

#### **B. No Three-Day Notice for Nonpayment of Rent (Mr. Pike)**

**Argument**:  
The Plaintiffs have not served **Mr. Pike** with a valid **three-day notice** for nonpayment of rent. Even if they claim that rent was not paid, **Idaho law** requires that they serve a proper notice before initiating eviction proceedings, which they failed to do.

- **Key Points**:
    
    - **No Three-Day Notice**: The Plaintiffs never served the required notice for nonpayment of rent on Mr. Pike.
    - **Legal Requirement**: Idaho law mandates that landlords serve a three-day notice for nonpayment before eviction proceedings can begin.
- **Supporting Evidence**:
    
    - **Affidavit of Mr. Pike**: Testifying that he never received a valid three-day notice for nonpayment of rent.
- **Legal Basis**:
    
    - Under **Idaho Code § 6-303**, a landlord must serve a **three-day notice** for nonpayment of rent before initiating an eviction. Since the Plaintiffs failed to meet this requirement, the eviction cannot proceed against Mr. Pike.

---

### **3. Mr. Pike’s Lease and PTFA Protections**

Even if the court finds that the Plaintiffs are bona fide purchasers or ignores the procedural defects, **Mr. Pike’s lease** and protections under the **Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act (PTFA)** provide additional defenses.

---

#### **A. Valid Lease and Pre-Sale Agreement**

**Argument**:  
Mr. Pike’s lease was validly renewed on **February 28, 2024**, one day before the foreclosure sale, as part of a **binding pre-sale agreement**. At that time, there was no reason to expect the foreclosure to occur, given the pre-sale agreement between Mr. Bass and Carrington Mortgage. **Mr. Pike’s lease remains valid** and enforceable, and the Plaintiffs must honor it or provide **90 days’ notice**.

- **Key Points**:
    
    - **Valid Lease**: The lease was signed in good faith the day before the foreclosure, and neither party expected the sale to take place, due to the pre-existing agreement to cure the default.
    - **90-Day Notice Requirement**: Even if the Plaintiffs contest the lease, **federal law under the PTFA** requires them to provide Mr. Pike with **90 days’ notice** before eviction.
- **Supporting Evidence**:
    
    - **Residential Lease Agreement**: Signed between Mr. Pike and Mr. Bass on **February 28, 2024**.
    - **Affidavit of Mr. Bass and Mr. Pike**: Confirming the lease was signed as part of the normal process, with no expectation of a foreclosure.
- **Legal Basis**:
    
    - The **Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act (PTFA)** requires purchasers of foreclosed properties to either honor **existing bona fide leases** or provide **90 days’ notice** before eviction. Mr. Pike’s lease was validly renewed before the foreclosure, and the Plaintiffs must either honor it or provide the required notice under **12 U.S.C. § 5220**.

---

#### **B. Plaintiffs Failed to Redirect Rent Payments**

**Argument**:  
The Plaintiffs failed to provide **clear instructions** for **redirecting rent payments** after the foreclosure. Mr. Pike continued paying rent to **Mr. Bass**, as the **Notice to Vacate** did not properly direct him to pay the rent to the Plaintiffs.

- **Key Points**:
    
    - **Lack of Direction**: The Plaintiffs did not properly notify Mr. Pike of where to send rent payments after the foreclosure.
    - **Compliance with Lease**: Mr. Pike continued to comply with his lease by paying rent to Mr. Bass, as the Plaintiffs failed to provide alternative instructions.
- **Supporting Evidence**:
    
    - **Affidavit of Mr. Pike**: Confirming that he continued paying rent to Mr. Bass because the Notice to Vacate did not provide clear instructions on where to send rent payments.
- **Legal Basis**:
    
    - Under the **PTFA**, tenants are required to comply with their lease obligations. Since Mr. Pike followed the instructions provided to him and continued paying rent, he is not in default. The Plaintiffs cannot claim nonpayment as grounds for eviction.

---

### **4. Challenge to Plaintiffs' Request for Writ of Ejectment**

Finally, the Plaintiffs’ request for a **writ of ejectment** is premature and invalid because they have failed to meet the necessary **legal requirements for eviction**.

---

#### **A. Plaintiffs Failed to Serve Proper Eviction Notices**

**Argument**:  
The Plaintiffs’ request for a writ of ejectment is invalid because they failed to serve **proper eviction notices** on both **Mr. Bass** and **Mr. Pike**. The notices were incomplete and failed to meet the legal requirements under Idaho law.

- **Key Points**:
    
    - **Incomplete Notices**: The eviction notices were legally defective because they referenced an attached deed that was never provided.
    - **Failure to Serve Valid Notice**: Without valid notices, the Plaintiffs have no legal basis for their request for ejectment.
- **Supporting Evidence**:
    
    - **Copies of Eviction Notices**: Showing the missing attachments.
    - **Affidavits of Mr. Bass and Mr. Pike**: Confirming that the referenced deed was never provided with the eviction notice.
- **Legal Basis**:
    
    - Under **Idaho Code § 6-303**, an eviction notice must provide all necessary information to inform the recipient of the grounds for eviction. Since the notices were defective, the Plaintiffs’ request for a **writ of ejectment** is invalid.

---

### **5. The Principle of Favoring the Non-Moving Party**

In all of the defenses raised, we also emphasize that as the **non-moving party**, the court is obligated to **liberally construe the facts** in favor of Mr. Bass and Mr. Pike, along with all reasonable inferences from the evidence.

- **Legal Precedent**:
    - **Suitts v. First Sec. Bank of Idaho, N.A., 125 Idaho 27, 31 (Idaho Ct. App. 1994)**: “The court should liberally construe the facts in favor of the party opposing the motion, together with all reasonable inferences from the evidence.”
    - **Bunker Hill Co. v. United Steelworkers of America, 107 Idaho 155 (1984)** and **Anderson v. City of Pocatello, 112 Idaho 176 (1986)**: The court must draw reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of the non-moving party.

Said we qualify but they because it was a landlord issue denied us. Even with the landlord doing very illegal things. Never go here for landlord issues, you’ll just be turned away.

They do not help defendants of PFAs. I am the victim being abused and have no means to defend myself without finances for an attorney.

No confidentiality. Went seeking aid, was talked to in small lobby area in front of other waiting clients. Was suggested to seek protective services from them from the department of resources in adams county for help to get away from a family cult, and they wouldn't give me the time of day to explain my situation. I was not seeking a pfa, i was seeking an exit plan from a cult. Insulted and not heard. Go elsewhere.

I believe in my own opinion I suggest to change their mission statement and vision statement.  It may be very misleading and in my own opinion may be false to some extent.  Our interaction with this place, the person who answered the door, their demeanor was very rude and unhelpful. Good luck

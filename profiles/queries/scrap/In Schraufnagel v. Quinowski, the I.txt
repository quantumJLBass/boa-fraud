In Schraufnagel v. Quinowski, the Idaho Court of Appeals held that a pro se litigant's misunderstanding of court procedure constituted excusable neglect under Idaho R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1). The court reversed the district court's denial of relief from summary judgment, noting that the pro se litigant's literal interpretation of the trial notice was reasonable and that the district court should have granted relief Schraufnagel v. Quinowski, 113 Idaho 753. 


- In Jones v. Kootenai County Title Ins. Co., the Idaho Supreme Court held that the trial court should not have granted summary judgment dismissing the fraud claim based on the statute of limitations because there were genuine issues of material fact concerning when Jones knew or should have known of any fraud perpetrated on him. The court emphasized that the statute of limitations for fraud claims begins to run when the plaintiff discovers, or reasonably should have discovered, the fraud Jones v. Kootenai County Title Ins. Co., 125 Idaho 607. 


 - In Jemmett v. McDonald (in Re Estate of Jemmett), the Idaho Supreme Court held that the right to contest a deed on grounds of duress, fraud, or undue influence is subject to a three-year statute of limitations. The court noted that the statute of limitations does not begin to run against an action based upon fraud until the plaintiff, in the exercise of proper diligence, discovers the facts constituting the fraud Jemmett v. McDonald (in Re Estate of Jemmett), 136 Idaho 277. 


 - In Stephens v. Stearns, the Idaho Supreme Court held that the two-year statute of limitations for professional malpractice applied, but the six-year limit for tort actions arising out of the design or construction of improvements to real property also had to be considered. The court noted that the plaintiff's cause of action did not accrue until the plaintiff possessed a cause of action against the defendant, which was when the plaintiff discovered the alleged negligence Stephens v. Stearns, 106 Idaho 249. 

 - In Billings v. Sisters of Mercy, the Idaho Supreme Court held that the cause of action for medical malpractice accrued when the patient discovered the foreign object left in her body during surgery, not when the object was actually left. This case illustrates the application of the discovery rule, which delays the start of the statute of limitations period until the plaintiff discovers, or reasonably should have discovered, the injury Billings v. Sisters of Mercy, 86 Idaho 485. 




*************************
******* !!!!!!!!
The Idaho Supreme Court has addressed the issue of statutes of limitations in the context of fraud in several cases. In "Gerlach v. Schultz," the court held that the statute of limitations for an action based on fraud begins to run only from the time the fraud is discovered or could have been discovered with reasonable diligence. The court emphasized that if a party is prevented by fraud from availing themselves of the benefit of the record or is led to forego an investigation, those who participate in the fraud cannot insist that the duty to investigate be enforced Gerlach v. Schultz, 72 Idaho 507. 




 Additionally, in "Barnett v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. ," the court reiterated that the statute of limitations for fraud is three years and applies from the time the fraud is discovered. The court noted that the substance of the action, rather than its form, governs the application of the statute of limitations Barnett v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 99 Idaho 246. 



 Furthermore, in "Drakos v. Sandow," the court highlighted that a perpetual or indefinite waiver of the statute of limitations is void as against public policy. The court explained that the purpose of the statute of limitations is to prevent fraudulent and stale actions from arising after a significant lapse of time Drakos v. Sandow, 167 Idaho 159. 



 These cases collectively establish that the statute of limitations does not legitimize fraud or make it valid or binding. Instead, the statute of limitations for fraud actions in Idaho begins to run from the time the fraud is discovered, ensuring that fraudulent actions cannot be legitimized merely by the passage of time Gerlach v. Schultz, 72 Idaho 507, Barnett v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 99 Idaho 246, Drakos v. Sandow, 167 Idaho 159. 



3. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 899
The Restatement supports the principle that statutes of limitations do not validate fraud. Section 899, comment e, states:

"The running of the statute of limitations merely bars the remedy, it does not extinguish the right. The statute of limitations does not legitimize the wrongful conduct itself or transform the underlying wrongdoing into lawful behavior."


4. City of McCall v. Buxton, 83 P.3d 763 (Idaho 2003)
This Idaho Supreme Court decision reinforces that fraud is a significant issue in courts, and while statutes of limitations may limit the time to bring a lawsuit, they do not legitimize the underlying fraudulent conduct. The court allowed equitable tolling because of fraudulent concealment.

“Where a party has been prevented from discovering the fraud by the defendant’s concealment, the statute of limitations is tolled until the fraud is discovered.”








"It is well-settled that a statute of limitations does not make an invalid act, such as fraud, valid or binding. Rather, it merely bars the remedy and not the right. In United States v. Minor, the Court emphasized that statutes of limitations 'merely prevent the remedy, but do not extinguish the right' (114 U.S. 233, 240 (1885)). The statute of limitations is, therefore, procedural rather than substantive, and it does not legitimize or validate acts of fraud. Moreover, the doctrine of equitable tolling may apply in cases of fraud, allowing for the statute of limitations to be extended where the wronged party did not discover the fraudulent conduct until after the limitations period had run (see Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U.S. 392, 397 (1946))."




 - In Esquivel v. State, the court affirmed that the amended statute of limitations was not retroactive and that the defendant had adequate time to file his petition under the new limitation period. The court emphasized that the statute of limitations is procedural and does not violate substantial rights if a reasonable time is provided to assert the cause of action Esquivel v. State, 128 Idaho 390.

Taylor v. Just, 138 Idaho 137 (2002)
The trustee's sale was voided after the grantor and beneficiary entered into a pre-sale agreement that cured the default, rendering the sale unnecessary.  The trustee's sale was invalidated because the default had been cured through a pre-sale agreement between the grantor and beneficiary. The sale proceeded despite the resolution of the default, leading the court to void the sale.

Security Pacific Finance Corp. v. Bishop, 109 Idaho 25 (1985)
The trustee's sale was invalidated due to procedural defects in the non-judicial foreclosure process. The court ruled that the sale must be set aside . This case involved a non-judicial foreclosure where the trustee's sale was invalidated. The borrower challenged the sale on grounds including usury, and the court set aside the sale.



 - In Fannie Mae v. Ormesher, the Idaho District Court for Kootenai County addressed a wrongful foreclosure claim where the defendants alleged that the plaintiff did not own the promissory note at the time of the foreclosure and did not properly notify the trustee's sale. The court noted that Fannie Mae was not the entity that initiated the foreclosure proceedings, and the foreclosure sale was conducted by Northwest Trustee Services, Inc. The court's decision focused on the procedural aspects of the foreclosure and the validity of the trustee's sale Fannie Mae v. Ormesher, 2014 Ida. Dist. LEXIS 31. 


Federal National Mortgage Ass'n v. Hafer, 158 Idaho 694 (2015)

The Idaho Supreme Court voided a trustee's sale because the default had been resolved before the foreclosure, which rendered the sale unauthorized under Idaho law.

            <actionDescription>On June 15, 2013, the Exchange alleged that Merrill Lynch Commodities (Europe) Limited (MLCE) on two occasions offered sell orders on the Exchange which lowered the best asking price of an Exchange product. While offering the sell orders MLCE allegedly bought larger quantities in the over-the-counter market and paid the same price as the price of its sell orders. The Exchange found that the sell orders gave or were likely to give misleading signals as to the supply and price of the Exchange product, and that the sell orders most likely were offered with intent to improperly influence the trading of other market participants. The Exchange therefore determined that MLCE violated the prohibition against market manipulation set out in the Market Conduct Rules, section 5.1. The Exchange further deemed it to be mitigating that the potential benefit from the manipulative activity was limited.</actionDescription>

            <actionDescription>The NYMEX (the Exchange) alleged that Merrill Lynch Commodities, Inc. (MLCI) violated NYMEX Rule 432.W when, on trade date April 29, 2013, a trader employed by MLCI failed to monitor the operation of a Crude Oil auto-spreader utilized by MLCI, minimizing the auto-spreader application and failing to monitor the order modification activity. This resulted in the auto spreader streaming price modifications and disclosing prices to the market that were not viable, requiring the Exchange to initiate a port closure on April 29, 2013. MLCI failed to diligently supervise its trader in a manner sufficient to ensure that the auto-spreader was adequately monitored and maintained.</actionDescription>

Are all the causes of action well cited and without flaw

Ambiguous

The document does not explicitly state that all the causes of action are without flaw, but it does provide substantial detail and citations (pg. 1) as well as detailed explanations for each one (pgs. 16-22), suggesting that they are well-reasoned and supported. However, a definitive answer would require further analysis.

What other case laws, authorities, codes, rules, etc., would strengthen this pleading that can be added

Cite more codes/cases/rules

To strengthen this pleading, additional authorities that could be cited include Idaho Code §§ 45-1506, 6-101, 48-603, cases such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Rader, Bank of America, N.A. v. Owens, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Cherry, and In re Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC, and rules of evidence such as Idaho Rules of Evidence Rule 803 (pgs. 1-3, 5, 7-10, 16, 22).

Are there indispensable parties missing that you could name or identify

Insufficient

The document does not explicitly mention any indispensable parties that are missing, but it does allow for the possibility of adding or removing parties in the future (pg. 8). Additionally, the document mentions a few entities that could potentially be relevant, such as "Original Bank" and "a benefactor who pays off a loan" (pgs. 11, 18).

What are other causes of actions that could and should be in the pleading

Many options

The document mentions several causes of action (pgs. 8,9) but there are additional potential causes of action that could be included in the pleading, such as breach of contract, unjust enrichment, violations of consumer protection laws, breach of fiduciary duty, intentional infliction of emotional distress, or negligent infliction of emotional distress (pgs. 17, 20, 22, 23).

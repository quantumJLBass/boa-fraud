Case No. CV35221875 MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF CO-COUNSEL DEMAND FOR JURY 9 1. Introduction 10 COMES NOW Plaintiff, JEREMY L. BASS, a pro se litigant, 11 respectfully moves the Court for the appointment of co-12 counsel to assist in the representation of their case. The 13 Plaintiff faces challenges in navigating the complexities of 14 the legal system and competing against experienced opposing 15 counsel. This motion is grounded in the principles of 16 fairness, equal access to justice, and effective 17 representation for the Plaintiff. 18 19 MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF CO-COUNSEL PAGE 2 2. Legal Authorities and Grounds for Appointment of Co-Counsel 1 The following legal authorities support the appointment of 2 co-counsel for the Plaintiff: 3 I. U.S. Constitution: 4 a. Fifth Amendment - Guaranteeing due process of law. 5 b. Fourteenth Amendment - Ensuring that no state shall 6 deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without 7 due process of law. 8 II. Idaho Code: 9 a. Idaho Code ยง 7-610 - Allowing the court to appoint counsel 10 for an indigent person in civil cases. 11 III. Case Law: 12 a. Lassiter v. Department of Social Services, 452 U.S. 18 13 (1981) - Recognizing that due process may require 14 appointment of counsel in certain civil cases. 15 b. In re Marriage of Cabrera, 122 Idaho 156, 159 (1991) - 16 Noting that the appointment of counsel for indigent persons 17 in civil matters is within the discretion of the court. 18 c. Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817 (1977) - Establishing the 19 right to access legal resources and assistance for 20 incarcerated individuals. 21 d. Airey v. Ireland, 32 Eur. Ct. H.R. (ser. A) (1979) - 22 Holding that lack of legal assistance in civil cases may 23 MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF CO-COUNSEL PAGE 3 impair effective access to court when the case involves 1 complex legal issues or when the litigant is at a 2 significant disadvantage. 3 e. Smith v. Williams, 782 F.2d 867 (9th Cir. 1986) - 4 Recognizing that pro se litigants are at a disadvantage due 5 to their unfamiliarity with the rules of procedure and 6 substantive law. 7 f. Turner v. Rogers, 564 U.S. 431 (2011) - Acknowledging that 8 certain procedural safeguards may be required for 9 unrepresented litigants in civil cases. 10 3. Argument for Appointment of Co-Counsel 11 I. The Plaintiff faces challenges due to their pro se status, 12 which places them at a significant disadvantage against 13 experienced opposing counsel. Furthermore, the Plaintiff 14 lacks access to legal resources such as PACER, which 15 hinders their ability to effectively research and prepare 16 their case. 17 II. The appointment of co-counsel would help level the playing field by providing the Plaintiff with limited assistance in understanding complex legal issues, navigating procedural rules, and accessing essential legal resources. This would ensure that the Plaintiff's right to due process and equal access to justice is protected. MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF CO-COUNSEL PAGE 4 III. The appointment of co-counsel would not shift full responsibility for the case from the Plaintiff to the appointed attorney. The co-counsel would serve in an advisory role for limited periods, such as a few hours of consultation or during pretrial sessions. This approach would maintain the spirit of pro se litigation, as the Plaintiff would continue to bear primary responsibility for their case. IV. The Court has discretion to appoint co-counsel for indigent litigants in civil matters under Idaho Code ยง 7- 610 and in accordance with the legal authorities discussed above. The appointment of co-counsel would serve the interests of justice by addressing the Plaintiff's disadvantages in terms of legal knowledge, experience, and access to resources. V. By analogy, courts have recognized the need to provide assistance to individuals with mental disabilities or impairments in civil proceedings. This rationale supports the appointment of co-counsel for the Plaintiff, who faces similar disadvantages as a pro se litigant lacking the tools and experience of opposing counsel. 4. Conclusion MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF CO-COUNSEL PAGE 5 I. In light of the foregoing, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court exercise its discretion and appoint co-counsel to assist in the representation of their case. By doing so, the Court would help ensure that the Plaintiff's right to due process and equal access to justice is protected, while maintaining the spirit of pro se litigation. This appointment would serve the interests of justice by addressing the Plaintiff's disadvantages in terms of legal knowledge, experience, and access to resources, thus creating a more equitable legal environment for all parties involved.

Don't use this company. They never sent me my mail. They allowed my corporation to forfeit its right to conduct business. I have been sending emails for several different reasons. One of the emails received a response 11 months later. The other concerns have not been responded to. I've called and left voicemails. No response.

Everyone who works here is either lazy or slow. Also the building is filthy and the layout is awful, whose child designed it??? Left a present in the first floor bathrooms.

I want to know why I'm not getting employed here. I've interviewed at this company 4-6 times in the last 3 years. I'm smart and learn fast. At least I'm someone that actually wants to work and not be on unemployment. Unbelievable 👎🏻

Edit: November 2023- I had two interviews with them and still didn't get the position, which was still strange to me because they said my resume was very impressive and one of the interviewers stated the same thing. But the one thing I did notice in the interview was that the one of them (2 interviewers) questioned my resume a lot and asked who I was and what my hobbies were. He then stated: well, if you want to be part of this company, you have to have to be a team player and come to happy hours, and really be apart of everyone's life and it can't just be about you all the time. It was very strange because he automatically assumed I would be a certain way while HE asked me about my background. I'm SO glad I didn't get this job. I found another job where I'm happy, get treated with respect, and get spoiled with gifts around Christmas and everyone is incredibly nice and not fake, and my hours are amazing.From other reviews I've seen for CSC, I probably would have hated this job and the schedule. There's a lot of negative reviews for this company. So thank you for not hiring me. I'm better off!

Nice so you're the worlds largest ponzi scheme. We met earlier today. I don't know if you remember me or not but, I'm one of the people who is in use of one of the bank accounts you have your teeth sank in. You're screwed guy!

I used them to form a corporation for me.  They incorrectly filed CSC as the registered agent, instead of the correct registered agent, then charged my $235.  I disputed the charge and had them correct the registered agent with the state, but they continue to send me notices that the invoice is unpaid.  I've emailed multiple people several times with NO RESPONSE to get this cleared up.  Now they sent me a notice that the invoice is going to collections!  How can people do business like this?

I have been  employed since 2011 through 2017 with this company. I have made a lot of money for them , consistently pulling numbers doubling and tripling performance of others. Besides being severely underpaid and overworked, it was OK job but I would like to share my experience AFTER  I left the company. Almost 2 years after me leaving CSC To my very big surprise I have received W-2 form for  something like $300-$350. I called and inquired about this income that I have not actually received . They explained to me, That this was due to a gift I have received from CSC  while I worked there. You see, if you happen to save the company a lot of money by coming up with some interesting thing, they would throw you a few bucks or a prize as a reward. Since I came up with several of such projects, one of those for example was  automated pricing tool which saved hours by numerous employees daily. I have earned about $300 and  ordered myself a north face jacket which to be honest did not fit.So basically they sent me invoice for that jacket. They also told me no taxes were withheld by them. Well , it doesn't mean I don't have to pay taxes , it  just doesn't come out of their pocket !! I had to pay  taxes on top of money that I have not received! what a gift huh . It was not worth the hustle,  so I just paid and moved on. What I'm trying to say, this company will nickel and dime you. The nickel and dimed me while I worked there, and they found a way to take advantage  of me when I stopped. I'm posting my review publicly as I have nothing to hide , this is all truth and there's a lot more to it .

Attended a fall festival for the employees and I was impressed. Having never set foot into a corporate office, the building was really nice. It was clean, bright and comfortable to be in and everyone was in good spirits.

The absolute worst place I have ever worked I would give it 0 stars if I could. Management is overrun with nepotism, and the focus on metrics creates a hostile work environment where people get commended for taking credit for someone else's work. On top of that, they pay their employees far below industry standards.

Clearly the employees in their accounting area have ZERO clue as to why entities are established or what happens when businesses shut down.
A registered agent that advises a client to act against their own best interest so that they can collect a $170 fee - I'll pass.  There are way too many excellent registered agents that know how to work with entrepreneurs to be bothered with a company that seeks to intentionally misinform their clients.
AWFUL!!

CSC is, by far, the most phenomenal company I've ever been a part of.  I've dealt with some horrific treatment in my last two jobs and was terrified of working customer service again, but sure enough the moment I was hired, I was treated with respect in a company full of amazing people.  I'm so happy to be here!

THESE PEOPLE ARE THIEVES --- RUN AWAY WHILE YOU CAN!!!!

They charge something like $300 - $350 per year for simple registered agent services that you can easily get for as little as $50 elsewhere.  An extremely greedy, money-grubbing, dishonest company that employs armies of collection staff to try to extort money from people who have even cancelled their service.  AVOID, AVOID, you can do way better with genuine service-oriented companies instead of these scam artists.  They don't even tell you how much they'll charge for their services ahead of time, till you've given them all your information so they can endlessly call and otherwise harass you to sign up with them!!

I was terminated from CSC on the two month anniversary of my father committing suicide. And this was after nearly 3 years of consistently above average service with no  history of major issues / prior errors. I made a couple of procedural errors within the first couple of weeks back from my bereavement and was fired for that. They gave me a "severance package" of sorts, just one month of pay and a couple months of sub-par health insurance. I think they knew deep down that this termination was not morally correct. I've been waiting for over a year to write this in order to let the initial shock and anger pass, but I must say, it still feels as though I was unfairly terminated due to the stigma associated with not only my father having committed suicide, but also they had no apparent training or overall interest in understanding my own mental health as a result. My manager (and former teammate) was both very new at her job and was under tons of stress since she was late into her first pregnancy. So I try to keep this in mind when I think of CSC and the decision she made to proceed with terminating me. However, at the end of the day, when you look at the situation, it begs the question if CSC has ever truly taken a stance of solidarity with their employees suffering from mental illness and things of the like. I recall my manager as well as the head of CSC's entire HR department admittedly "not understanding how it felt" in regards to returning to work after one of your parents has committed suicide, which in my opinion is unacceptable for a company of that size and scope. As a result, I would not recommend CSC to my friends, family, or otherwise as a workplace worth working at.

Charlatans and Swindlers.  They do NOTHING.  Do not use!  Seriously, register directly with the State Department of Commerce.  It's super easy and WAY more responsive.

False charges for a corporation that doesn't exist.  They try tricking you into paying for something that you have not utilized.

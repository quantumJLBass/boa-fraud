Analysis of Court's Opinion and Defendant's Filings
Court's Opinion 1
The court's opinion in "Opinion and Order on Defendant Bass's Motion for Reconsideration.pdf" raises several points:

No valid default: The court states that the record does not support Defendant Bass's argument of no valid default, citing his failure to make timely payments.    

Defendant's filings: Defendant Bass argues that a verbal agreement existed with Carrington Mortgage Services to allow him to cure the debt, forgoing the foreclosure and Trustee's Sale. He claims this is supported by his payments for property taxes and insurance. 
Analysis: The court's opinion fails to address the defendant's claim of a verbal agreement and part performance as an exception to the Statute of Frauds. The court should have evaluated the evidence and arguments related to this claim.    
  
No collusion: The court finds no evidence to support Defendant Bass's assertion of collusion, stating that he fails to connect Glenda Morlan to the Plaintiffs and that the video clips of the sale do not show any issues.    

Defendant's filings: Defendant Bass provides evidence of collusion in the form of a Facebook Messenger chat log (Exhibit A) and a recorded conversation (Exhibit B) with Glenda Morlan, a local property developer, discussing irregularities and intimidation tactics. 
Analysis: The court acknowledges the evidence but fails to address the defendant's claim that Morlan's statements about a rigged auction and pre-arranged bids constitute evidence of collusion. The court should have analyzed this evidence in light of the defendant's claims.    
  
Check with the correct amount: The court states that it is not uncommon for a buyer's representative to have a check with the correct amount at a Trustee's Sale, citing Breckenridge Property Fund 2016, LLC v. Wally Enterprises, Inc.    

Defendant's filings: Defendant Bass argues that the Plaintiffs' representative arriving at the auction with pre-printed checks indicates pre-arranged bidding and manipulation of the auction process. 
Analysis: The court's reliance on the Breckenridge case may be misplaced, as that case dealt with the form of payment rather than pre-arranged bid amounts. The court should have addressed the defendant's specific claim of pre-arranged bids indicated by the pre-printed checks.    
  
No failure to comply with statutory requirements: The court finds no support for Defendant Bass's contention of failure to comply with statutory requirements for non-judicial foreclosure, stating that he only provides conclusory allegations without evidence.    

Defendant's filings: Defendant Bass cites several Idaho and federal statutes governing auctions and trustee's duties, arguing that the auction was fixed and violated these statutory requirements. 
Analysis: The court's opinion does not address the defendant's specific arguments related to the cited statutes. The court should have evaluated whether the facts of the case, in light of the defendant's evidence, constituted a violation of these statutes.    
  
Defendant's Response filings: The court states that it did not consider Defendant Bass's Response filings (Section C, D, and E) at summary judgment and finds no basis to consider them in support of the motion to reconsider.    

Defendant's filings: Defendant Bass filed these responses to address specific allegations in the Plaintiffs' Reply Memorandum, arguing that they raise genuine issues of material fact. 
Analysis: The court's refusal to consider these filings may be procedural, as they were filed after the initial Opinion and Order on Motion to Dismiss. However, the court should have clarified its reasoning for not considering these filings, especially if they contained relevant evidence or arguments.    
  
Defendant's Filings
Defendant Bass's filings in "defendant-2024-12-16.pdf" raise several points that are not fully addressed in the court's opinion:

Breach of contract: Defendant Bass argues that Carrington Mortgage Services breached a verbal agreement to allow him to pay off the house, supported by his payments for taxes and insurance.    

Court's opinion: The court's opinion does not address this claim, including the defendant's argument that the agreement is enforceable under the doctrine of part performance.    
Conflict of interest: Defendant Bass argues that IDEA Law Group, the trustee, had a conflict of interest due to its relationships with Carrington Mortgage Services, undermining the fairness of the foreclosure process.    

Court's opinion: The court's opinion does not address this claim, which raises questions about the trustee's impartiality and potential bias in favor of the mortgage servicer.    
Federal antitrust laws: Defendant Bass argues that the Plaintiffs' actions constitute a violation of federal antitrust laws, specifically the Sherman Antitrust Act, due to bid-rigging and collusion.    

Court's opinion: The court's opinion does not address this claim, which could have jurisdictional implications as violations of the Sherman Act are typically tried in federal court.    
Tenant rights: Defendant Bass argues that the Plaintiffs breached the lease agreement with Defendant Pike by failing to maintain essential utilities, violating tenant rights under Idaho law and the Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act (PTFA).    

Court's opinion: The court's opinion does not address this claim, which is relevant to the ejectment action as it questions the Plaintiffs' right to evict based on non-payment of rent when they allegedly breached the lease.    
Joint List of Points and Evaluation



------------------------------


Here is the plan of action to ensure a complete and thorough review of the Opinion and Order on Defendant Bass's Motion for Reconsideration (Court's document) and the Defendant's filings (Defendant's combined document). I will:

Extract and list the points addressed by the Court in the Opinion and Order.
List and summarize the key arguments raised in the Defendant's filings.
Compare each point from the Court's opinion to the corresponding arguments from the Defendant's filings:
Check if the Court addressed or skipped any points.
Assess if the Court misrepresented or overlooked arguments.
Validate whether the Court's reasoning is accurate in light of Defendant's arguments and cited case law.
Provide detailed explanations, quoting the relevant sections from both documents.
Step 1: Extract Key Points from the Court's Opinion
From the Opinion and Order, the Court primarily addressed the following arguments from Defendant Bass:

Challenge to Trustee's Sale:

Defendant argued "procedural and substantive improprieties" rendered the sale invalid.
The Court found no evidence supporting these claims.
Collusion and Misconduct:

Defendant claimed misconduct and collusion during the auction process.
The Court dismissed this for lack of supporting evidence.
Invalid Default:

Defendant argued there was no legitimate default on payments.
The Court cited evidence of default from January 1, 2020, until the Trustee's Sale.
Statutory Non-Compliance:

Defendant alleged the auction violated statutory requirements.
The Court stated the Trustee's Deed is "prima facie evidence" of compliance and dismissed unsupported allegations.
Failure to Consider Specific Documents:

Defendant referred to responses filed in Section C, D, and E.
The Court noted these documents were filed after the summary judgment order and were not referenced in prior arguments.
Application of Case Law:

Defendant cited multiple Idaho cases (e.g., Breckenridge, Baker, Taylor).
The Court reviewed the cases and determined they did not alter the prior ruling.
Step 2: Summarize Key Arguments in Defendant's Filings
From the Defendant's combined filings, Bass's key arguments were:

Invalid Default:

Argued payments or verbal agreements invalidated the default.
Claimed substantive defects voided the sale under Baker v. Nationstar.
Collusion and Pre-Arranged Bids:

Highlighted pre-printed checks matching bid amounts as evidence of collusion.
Referenced Breckenridge to argue against pre-coordinated bidding.
Statutory Non-Compliance:

Asserted violations of Idaho Code §§ 45-1506 and 45-1508.
Cited Taylor v. Just and Spencer v. Jameson to argue strict compliance was required.
Lack of Fair Market Value:

Argued the property was sold below fair market value due to misconduct.
Material Irregularities:

Presented video/audio evidence and messaging (e.g., Glenda Morlan) as proof of auction irregularities.
Failure to Consider Defendant's Filings:

Asserted Section C, D, and E filings contained critical arguments overlooked by the Court.
Step 3: Point-by-Point Comparison and Analysis
Here is the detailed comparison of each argument:

Invalid Default:

Defendant's Argument: Bass argued the default was invalid based on verbal agreements or substantive defects.

Court's Response: The Court cited records showing missed payments from January 2020 onward as evidence of default.

Analysis: The Court addressed the "no default" argument but did not explicitly discuss verbal agreements or their legal impact under Idaho law.

What Could Be Improved: If Bass's verbal agreement was supported by evidence, the Court should have examined it under Baker v. Nationstar, which voids sales lacking a valid default.

Collusion and Pre-Arranged Bids:

Defendant's Argument: Evidence of pre-printed checks matching final bid amounts suggested collusion.

Court's Response: The Court dismissed this as a "conclusory statement" without supporting evidence and cited Breckenridge to justify common bidding procedures.

Analysis:

Breckenridge did not address pre-arranged bid amounts; it focused on payment forms at auctions.
The Defendant's argument about printed checks suggests a substantive irregularity that goes beyond Breckenridge.
What Was Overlooked: The Court failed to recognize that pre-arranged bid amounts could violate fair auction standards and statutory procedures.

Statutory Non-Compliance:

Defendant's Argument: Bass asserted Idaho Code § 45-1506 was violated.

Court's Response: The Trustee's Deed is prima facie evidence of compliance.

Analysis:

The Defendant provided detailed case law (Taylor v. Just, Spencer v. Jameson) supporting strict compliance.
The Court failed to discuss whether substantive irregularities (e.g., collusion) could overcome "prima facie" evidence.
Missed Opportunity: The Court did not engage with the Defendant's citations to case law requiring strict compliance.

Failure to Consider Section C, D, and E Filings:

Defendant's Argument: These filings contained critical arguments not addressed by the Court.

Court's Response: The documents were filed after summary judgment and not cited earlier.

Analysis:

While the timing issue is valid, the Court should have evaluated if these filings raised new material facts or arguments relevant to reconsideration.
What Could Be Improved: The Court dismissed these filings procedurally without addressing their substance.

Material Irregularities:

Defendant's Argument: Video/audio evidence and messages suggested procedural misconduct.

Court's Response: The evidence did not substantiate collusion claims.

Analysis:

The Court's dismissal appears cursory without detailing why the evidence was insufficient.
Missed Analysis: A clearer evaluation of Defendant's evidence and its relevance to statutory compliance would strengthen the ruling.

Conclusion and Next Steps
The Court addressed several of Defendant Bass's arguments but failed to:

Fully analyze the case law presented (e.g., Baker v. Nationstar, Taylor v. Just).
Engage with claims of pre-arranged bidding under statutory compliance.
Provide a substantive assessment of Section C, D, and E filings.
Next Steps:
Highlight these omissions in a response or appeal.
Reiterate the case law requiring strict compliance (Idaho Code § 45-1506) and the legal distinction between procedural and substantive defects.
Clarify how evidence provided (e.g., pre-arranged bids) supports claims of misconduct.




-------






COURT'S MAIN POINTS FROM THE OPINION:

Motion Standard:
The Opinion correctly states the standard for reconsideration under I.R.C.P. 11(a)(2), requiring new facts or law affecting the correctness of the order.
Regarding Default:
Opinion states (p.4): "Defendant Bass continues to argue there was no valid default, but the record is devoid of evidence which supports this argument."

However, in defendant's "MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE" (pp.1-2), Bass raised specific points about a verbal agreement with Carrington Mortgage Services including:

Agreement to allow payoff
Part performance evidenced by Bass paying taxes and insurance
Ongoing probate process
The Opinion does not address these substantive arguments about the agreement that could have prevented default.


Regarding Collusion:
Opinion states (p.4): "Defendant Bass continues to assert there was collusion, but again fails to support this argument with evidence."

However, in defendant's filings:

"DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF'S ALLEGATIONS IN SECTION C" (pp.2-4) details:

Admitted pre-auction coordination between plaintiffs and trustee
Pre-printed checks matching exact bid amounts
Communications with Glenda Morlan discussing auction rigging
Video evidence of the auction
The Opinion dismisses this evidence without explaining why it's insufficient.




Regarding Trustee's Sale Procedures:
Opinion cites Breckenridge Property Fund to dismiss concerns about pre-printed checks (p.4).

However, the defendant's "MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF RECONSIDERATION" (pp.2-3) distinguishes Breckenridge:

Breckenridge involved only payee issues
This case involves pre-determined bid amounts
Different legal implications between payment form and bid amount coordination
The Opinion does not address this distinction.


Late Filed Documents:
The Opinion states it did not consider three response documents filed October 21, 2023 because they were filed after the October 18, 2024 Opinion on Motion to Dismiss.

This appears to be a significant error as:

The dates listed are inconsistent (2023 vs 2024)
The documents appear to have been filed in response to plaintiffs' filings
The court does not explain why these responses were untimely or improper



Statutory Requirements:
Opinion states (p.5): "Defendant Bass fails to identify what failures of the statutory requirements he asserts happened here, beyond conclusory allegations."

However, in "MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE" (pp.3-6), Bass specifically cites:

Idaho Code § 45-1504 requirements for public auctions
Sherman Antitrust Act violations regarding bid rigging
Idaho Code § 55-809 regarding recorded instruments
Multiple other specific statutory provisions
The Opinion doesn't address these detailed statutory arguments.


Trustee's Deed Prima Facie Evidence:
Opinion relies heavily on I.C. § 45-1510 stating the Trustee's Deed is prima facie evidence.

However, defendant's "MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF RECONSIDERATION" (pp.8-10) argues:

Prima facie evidence can be rebutted
Presented evidence of irregularities
Cited specific case law about overcoming presumptions
The Opinion doesn't explain why this rebuttal evidence was insufficient.


Bona Fide Purchaser Status:
Opinion does not directly address the core legal argument about bona fide purchaser status.

In "DEFENDANT BASS' RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT" (pp.2-4), Bass argues:

Plaintiffs had prior knowledge of issues
Participated in auction manipulation
Cannot claim good faith status with such knowledge
The Opinion skips this fundamental legal issue.


Wrong Instrument Issue:
Opinion does not address Bass's argument about foreclosure on wrong instrument.

In "MOTION TO DISMISS AND STRIKE SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT" (p.1), Bass argues:

Foreclosure based on fraudulent instrument
Last uncontested recorded instrument was Letter of Full Reconveyance
This significant title issue is unaddressed.


Conflict of Interest:
Opinion doesn't address the alleged conflict of interest.

In "MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE" (pp.11-12), Bass details:

IDEA Law Group's relationship with Carrington
Shared board memberships
Industry connections affecting impartiality
This institutional bias argument is not considered.


Federal Jurisdiction:
Opinion doesn't address potential federal jurisdiction issues.

In "DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF'S ALLEGATIONS IN SECTION C" (pp.3-4), Bass argues:

Sherman Act violations require federal jurisdiction
State court may lack jurisdiction over antitrust claims
This jurisdictional challenge is unaddressed.

SYNTHESIS OF MAJOR ISSUES WITH THE OPINION:

Procedural Gaps:


Failed to explain why late-filed responses were excluded
Didn't address jurisdictional challenges
Skipped analysis of federal law implications


Evidence Evaluation:


Dismissed evidence without explaining why it was insufficient
Failed to analyze rebuttal of prima facie presumptions
Didn't weigh conflicting evidence properly


Legal Analysis Gaps:


No analysis of bona fide purchaser requirements
Skipped statutory interpretation of multiple cited laws
Failed to address distinction between procedural and substantive defects


Due Process Concerns:


Excluded defendant's responses without clear procedural basis
Failed to address all major arguments presented
Did not explain why evidence was insufficient

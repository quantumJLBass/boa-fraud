Dear Captain,

Thank you for your patience. I understand you may not have reviewed the materials I sent, including 50 PDFs via Dropbox. These documents are crucial for understanding the breadth of the issues at hand, including both civil and criminal violations.

My previous communications with Lonnie Richardson gave me some insight into your operations. However, the current situation seems unique. I've yet to receive any responses, and my interactions with law enforcement have been disheartening, particularly concerning the perceived nature of this as a civil matter. Yet, the evidence I hold indicates potential criminal activities, including felonies with severe penalties.

The foreclosure auction at Nez Perce Courthouse is part of a broader pattern involving collusion between Bank of America, local developers, and legal firms beyond Lewiston. My inability to secure legal representation, after contacting over 90 firms, suggests a conflict of interest fostered by the bank's relationships with these entities.

I believe I've amassed enough evidence to support RICO charges. However, my attempts to engage with the Nez Perce County Prosecutor’s Office have been fruitless thus far. My primary goal is to protect my home and ensure no further illegal actions are taken against me or my tenant. The foreclosure was unlawful, and the attempts to force us out are unjust.

I've managed to stay current with payments, refusing to be complicit in the bank's fraudulent activities. This fight has been ongoing for four years, and your intervention could be pivotal.

I am prepared to provide further clarification and eagerly await the opportunity to secure the safety of my home.

Best,
Jeremy Lee Bass















Dear Sir,

Thank you for acknowledging my previous correspondence. I understand you may not have had the opportunity to access the contents of the PDFs and Dropbox files yet. These documents hold significant information regarding the situation at hand, emphasizing the gravity of what we're dealing with. I'm reaching out again to provide a more detailed overview, including the original message below for your reference. Conversations with Lonnie Richardson had given me a glimpse into your processes, yet the issues I'm facing seem to diverge significantly from those discussions. To date, no formal rejections have been issued, primarily due to the lack of responses from the relevant parties.

In my conversation with an LDP officer, it was suggested that this matter might be civil, despite the clear criminal implications, including the possibility of felony charges with substantial penalties for individuals and corporations involved. This situation, however, is far from being an isolated incident, as demonstrated by the auction at the Nez Perce Courthouse steps, attended only by a developer who had previously attempted to intimidate me into selling before the auction. This is a small part of a larger pattern involving Bank of America and several developers, indicative of widespread collusion aimed at defrauding homeowners.

Despite reaching out to the Nez Perce County Prosecutor’s Office without a response, my primary focus remains on preventing any harm to my tenant and me, stemming from this illegitimate sale. Throughout this ordeal, I have maintained my capacity to fulfill financial obligations, refusing to be drawn into any fraudulent schemes.

This letter serves as a follow-up to the ISP captain, summarizing earlier communications and emphasizing the broader implications of the foreclosure auction's misconduct. Beyond the immediate issue of foreclosure, my experiences have uncovered a complex web of potential criminal activities, necessitating a comprehensive investigation to address not just the legality of the foreclosure but also the broader patterns of corruption and malfeasance threatening public trust and safety.

Best regards,
Jeremy Lee Bass




Dear Sir,

Thank you for considering my previous messages. I've noticed the PDFs and Dropbox links might still be pending your review. These documents hold extensive details about my situation. Although I've already sent a follow-up email, I'm including the original content here for convenience. From my past conversations with Lonnie Richardson, I understood a bit about how your operations work, yet this situation seems unique. Despite reaching out multiple times, I haven't received any feedback. An LDP officer, believing this to be a civil matter, promised to contact the mortgage servicing company but did not follow up with me after our brief conversation, despite my warnings of the criminal nature of the issues at hand, including potential felonies with severe penalties for individuals and corporations alike.



I've tried to engage the Nez Perce County Prosecutor’s Office without success, aiming to safeguard myself and my tenant from the consequences of the illicit sale. Throughout, I've been capable of fulfilling payment obligations, steadfastly refusing to partake in any fraudulent schemes.

This correspondence serves as a consolidated summary for the ISP captain, reiterating my ordeal and highlighting the broader implications of foreclosure fraud, potential connections to the fentanyl trade, and other severe allegations. These issues demand urgent, thorough investigation, highlighting systemic failings that extend far beyond a single property dispute, threatening public safety and the integrity of the legal system.

Best regards,
Jeremy Lee Bass

The auction, conducted on the Nez Perce Courthouse steps, was attended by a lone developer who had previously attempted to coerce me into selling my property before the auction, indicating a broader scheme involving Bank of America and local developers. 


Dear Sir,

Thank you for reviewing my correspondence. Your attention to the matter is greatly appreciated. It seems the PDFs and Dropbox links, which contain detailed information about the situation, may not have been accessed yet. When I sent the original email I may have not yet had your email and probelely why I only sent the follow-up email. Since the first email details much more, I pasted the original letter below for your convenience. In past conversations with Lonnie Richardson I got some insight into your operations and understand what you have told me, but the issues at hand seem to diverge from the norm. To date, my requests for engagement have gone unanswered by almost everyone, and this is the most interaction I have been afforded so far. When I talked to an LDP officer, it was for less than 2 minutes; he started off by saying my issue sounded like a civil matter, and despite the evidence I presented indicating potential criminal activities with significant penalties involved, I couldn't sway his bias.

This situation, however, is far from being an isolated incident, as demonstrated by the auction at the Nez Perce Courthouse steps, attended only by a developer who had previously attempted to intimidate me into selling before the auction(which I have on recording documenting the admissions to the crimes). This is a small part of a larger pattern involving Bank of America and several developers, indicative of widespread collusion aimed at defrauding homeowners. The auction, manipulated on the Nez Perce Courthouse steps, was attended by a lone developer who had previously attempted to coerce me into selling my property before the auction, indicating a broader scheme involving Bank of America and local developers. This incident reflects a broader issue, not confined to Lewiston, indicating a collusion between Bank of America and local developers. This arrangement severely undercuts property values and facilitates tax evasion, suggesting possible RICO charges. This pattern of behavior is not unique to Lewiston, involving collusion to devalue properties and evade taxes, suggesting RICO statute violations.

Attempts to engage with the Nez Perce County Prosecutor’s Office have so far been met with silence. My aim is to safeguard my tenant and myself from the fallout of what was an unlawful sale, but my inability to secure legal representation has made this very hard. After contacting over 90 firms and being told by most that would tell me why they couldn't help me that there was a conflict of interest, it was only after having that local developer try to scare me into selling to her ahead of the auction did she tell me that Bank of America had fostered relationships with these firms by rotating through all available firms. In the end, I am firstly trying to make sure that me and my tenant don't end up in any sort of mess, as the house sale was not legal, and it's just crazy to think we would just leave and let them steal the house.  I know there is a lot to read, and I will cut this off here for now, but I would like to leave with one more note.  I was able to make payments the whole time; they just tried to get me to commit a crime with them, which I refused. They said we needed to work out what happened, so I went on forbearance until we had sorted things out. Because it was a fraud that they were trying to cover up with me signing a back-dated contract for 2012 in 2021, they had to try and shake me after 4 years of this fight.  

I hope this better summarizes the extensive and multifaceted issues stemming from the foreclosure and highlighting broader criminal implications that warrant a thorough investigation. These concerns, ranging from the potential involvement in the fentanyl trade to egregious legal and ethical breaches, illustrate the urgent need for a response that transcends the immediate matter of foreclosure, implicating systemic failures with far-reaching consequences.

Yours sincerely,
Jeremy Lee Bass

The Plaintiff has included allegations against known and unknown parties in their request for leave to amend. Although the use of Doe Defendants is not favored in the Ninth Circuit (Gillespie v. Civiletti, 629 F.2d 637, 642 (9th Cir. 1980)), the Plaintiff should be given an opportunity through discovery to identify them, as suggested by Wakefield v. Thompson, 177 F.3d 1160, 1163 (9th Cir. 1999).
In light of the new facts and the urgency of the situation, as the sale is scheduled for tomorrow, the Plaintiff asks the Court to grant this Motion for Reconsideration, permit the amendment of the complaint, and issue a Temporary Restraining Order or Injunction to prevent the imminent foreclosure sale of the Plaintiff's property.

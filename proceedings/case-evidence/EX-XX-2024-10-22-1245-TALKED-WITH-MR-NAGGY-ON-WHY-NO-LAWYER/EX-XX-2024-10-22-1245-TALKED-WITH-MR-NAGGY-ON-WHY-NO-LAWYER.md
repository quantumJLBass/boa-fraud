0:02:58.720,0:03:03.400
have not no let me just finishing you

0:03:01.159,0:03:05.080
grab a seat I'm just in the middle of a

0:03:03.400,0:03:08.280
whole bunch of calls right now it's not

0:03:05.080,0:03:08.280
a problem I understand just a

0:03:20.560,0:03:25.680
second okay

0:03:22.879,0:03:28.560
um so did you have questions or just

0:03:25.680,0:03:31.040
want to talk about what's going on uh I

0:03:28.560,0:03:32.720
well uh

0:03:31.040,0:03:34.840
the same kind of thing that I keep

0:03:32.720,0:03:36.680
running into is is disbelief that I

0:03:34.840,0:03:39.400
can't find a lawyer it's not because I

0:03:36.680,0:03:41.760
don't have money I have money I

0:03:39.400,0:03:45.439
literally was going to pay $40,000 for

0:03:41.760,0:03:49.159
the one in Pocatello because I have like

0:03:45.439,0:03:51.680
there's 300,000 to uh $400,000 worth of

0:03:49.159,0:03:53.120
loss that I will receive from this from

0:03:51.680,0:03:55.280
this whole thing happening I it's not

0:03:53.120,0:03:56.640
like I didn't pay my mortgage I paid my

0:03:55.280,0:03:58.640
mortgage until they put me on

0:03:56.640,0:04:02.239
forbearance and then they strong armed

0:03:58.640,0:04:05.000
me on that follow that 300 to 400,000

0:04:02.239,0:04:07.959
loss if I lose my house yeah that that's

0:04:05.000,0:04:09.519
a300 to $400,000 loss for me so Dwayne

0:04:07.959,0:04:11.799
must have talked to you after I talked

0:04:09.519,0:04:13.599
to him about I just didn't understand

0:04:11.799,0:04:15.480
why you can't find a lawyer is that why

0:04:13.599,0:04:18.040
yeah yeah which is the same thing that I

0:04:15.480,0:04:19.880
receive from most everyone is well

0:04:18.040,0:04:21.639
that's hard to believe or or things like

0:04:19.880,0:04:23.560
that and it's like it's not because I

0:04:21.639,0:04:27.120
just literally don't have money uh and

0:04:23.560,0:04:30.199
and in fact this office here yeah uh I I

0:04:27.120,0:04:31.639
contacted here uh asking for for help

0:04:30.199,0:04:34.600
and they said that there's conflict of

0:04:31.639,0:04:36.120
interest ask why no idea um they won't

0:04:34.600,0:04:37.880
you know they can't tell me was that

0:04:36.120,0:04:39.919
after Dwayne came to us oh no it was

0:04:37.880,0:04:42.600
well well before like I contacted two

0:04:39.919,0:04:45.000
years ago and then earlier uh this year

0:04:42.600,0:04:47.039
before uh the court when the court case

0:04:45.000,0:04:49.960
happened we wouldn't have had a conflict

0:04:47.039,0:04:51.440
of interest but your case is not the

0:04:49.960,0:04:54.880
type of case that we're allowed to take

0:04:51.440,0:04:56.840
on yeah because yours is foreclosure

0:04:54.880,0:04:58.479
defense and they didn't even ask get

0:04:56.840,0:04:59.800
that far they literally tell you got my

0:04:58.479,0:05:01.360
social security number and then they

0:04:59.800,0:05:03.479
tell me it's conflict of interest and I

0:05:01.360,0:05:06.120
and they won't tell me why I asked repet

0:05:03.479,0:05:07.160
I contacted twice about this to hear

0:05:06.120,0:05:10.039
because I couldn't find a lawyer

0:05:07.160,0:05:13.080
anywhere and I've contacted uh everyone

0:05:10.039,0:05:14.800
in town I even had uh Jane McFarland uh

0:05:13.080,0:05:17.320
she gave me a list of people to contact

0:05:14.800,0:05:19.680
I've contacted through the uh the bar

0:05:17.320,0:05:23.319
association well wait let me first talk

0:05:19.680,0:05:25.319
about this office um I cannot believe

0:05:23.319,0:05:27.000
that they would tell you that they that

0:05:25.319,0:05:28.720
this office is a conflict of interest

0:05:27.000,0:05:31.520
because the only way we'd have a

0:05:28.720,0:05:33.639
conflict of interest is if we were

0:05:31.520,0:05:36.400
representing Dwayne already which you

0:05:33.639,0:05:39.520
say we weren't or if we

0:05:36.400,0:05:42.639
represented the foreclosing party which

0:05:39.520,0:05:45.120
we would never have done yeah so that

0:05:42.639,0:05:46.680
doesn't sound right I think you might

0:05:45.120,0:05:48.639
have misunderstood what they said no I

0:05:46.680,0:05:50.440
have it on recording uh I recorded the

0:05:48.639,0:05:52.120
conversation when I called because I

0:05:50.440,0:05:53.960
have record I keep record of all the

0:05:52.120,0:05:56.160
ones I've been doing do you know who it

0:05:53.960,0:05:57.479
is it was the receptionist know what her

0:05:56.160,0:05:59.360
name is I'd have to go back to the

0:05:57.479,0:06:01.560
recording to find out but um I did get

0:05:59.360,0:06:03.720
her name I'd like to hear it yeah yeah

0:06:01.560,0:06:06.319
that's a real problem if you were told

0:06:03.720,0:06:09.280
that yeah I can I can get that that's uh

0:06:06.319,0:06:10.800
and it is a second it was I've called a

0:06:09.280,0:06:13.560
couple times because I I pretty much

0:06:10.800,0:06:17.840
begged the last time just like pretty

0:06:13.560,0:06:19.720
much begged begged like please please I

0:06:17.840,0:06:21.720
need because I mean I I I've been very

0:06:19.720,0:06:24.840
desperate I by no means do I want to be

0:06:21.720,0:06:27.199
doing this by myself and do you have the

0:06:24.840,0:06:28.919
can you email me the recording yeah yeah

0:06:27.199,0:06:30.680
yeah I can would you would you please do

0:06:28.919,0:06:32.240
that yeah that I want to find because

0:06:30.680,0:06:35.479
they're not supposed to be saying that

0:06:32.240,0:06:38.240
unless it's true but I can't see how

0:06:35.479,0:06:39.639
because if if we had a c of interest for

0:06:38.240,0:06:40.960
you we would have had a conflict of

0:06:39.639,0:06:42.120
interest for Dwayne that's what I would

0:06:40.960,0:06:44.360
have thought too and that doesn't make

0:06:42.120,0:06:47.479
any sense so my guess is when you listen

0:06:44.360,0:06:50.360
to it again they probably said those are

0:06:47.479,0:06:53.880
we don't do those types of cases no I

0:06:50.360,0:06:56.360
100% it was competen because I I asked

0:06:53.880,0:06:58.879
her repetitively well not repetitively

0:06:56.360,0:07:01.000
but sorry no that's okay I've been

0:06:58.879,0:07:03.840
playing t okay with my daughter not a

0:07:01.000,0:07:05.430

0:07:39.800,0:07:42.960
pile of stuff from

0:07:43.000,0:07:49.240
inside

0:07:45.879,0:07:49.240
okay for

0:07:50.240,0:07:55.680
what oh okay all right you want to call

0:07:53.159,0:07:58.919
me when you get

0:07:55.680,0:08:02.560
there great okay or after you leave you

0:07:58.919,0:08:05.120

0:08:02.560,0:08:09.240
okay all right all right I'll talk to

0:08:05.120,0:08:11.280
you soon bye sorry about that just been

0:08:09.240,0:08:13.479
trying to reach her by phone I was on

0:08:11.280,0:08:15.199
the phone when she called and but these

0:08:13.479,0:08:17.720
phones keep ringing all the time I don't

0:08:15.199,0:08:19.560
blame you that sounds totally bizarre so

0:08:17.720,0:08:21.000
I want to hear that recording oh yeah

0:08:19.560,0:08:23.919
and the only reason why I'm so confident

0:08:21.000,0:08:25.440
in it is just because I I begged her I

0:08:23.919,0:08:27.240
was like can you give me any reason tell

0:08:25.440,0:08:28.599
me any reason how it is because I don't

0:08:27.240,0:08:30.520
see how you could have conflict of

0:08:28.599,0:08:32.519
interest she said nope can't tell you

0:08:30.520,0:08:34.080
I'm like okay that's the only reason why

0:08:32.519,0:08:35.800
I'm so sure about it it's because I I

0:08:34.080,0:08:37.880
begged about it you know if the person

0:08:35.800,0:08:40.599
said their name on the recing I'm pretty

0:08:37.880,0:08:42.640
sure they did because when I called I

0:08:40.599,0:08:44.720
you know started from uh from there so

0:08:42.640,0:08:47.959
they answered and said their name so you

0:08:44.720,0:08:51.040
can you can guarantee I can guarantee to

0:08:47.959,0:08:53.399
you that if that was nonsense I'll make

0:08:51.040,0:08:55.680
an issue of it okay because we can't be

0:08:53.399,0:08:57.399
doing that now with that said we would

0:08:55.680,0:08:59.079
not have been able to help you anyway

0:08:57.399,0:09:01.000
yeah but we're not supposed to be

0:08:59.079,0:09:02.839
providing in incorrect information that

0:09:01.000,0:09:04.920
we had a conflict of interest because

0:09:02.839,0:09:07.480
that just leads to confusion yeah it

0:09:04.920,0:09:10.040
definitely does and and and and that's

0:09:07.480,0:09:12.480
been half the problem here is that I get

0:09:10.040,0:09:15.000
two answers one don't practice in that

0:09:12.480,0:09:17.440
area so because I I've even tried family

0:09:15.000,0:09:19.800
law and and other lawyers and other

0:09:17.440,0:09:22.480
things they can't practice in that in uh

0:09:19.800,0:09:24.560
real estate or or contract law all right

0:09:22.480,0:09:27.360
fine and then I get conflict of interest

0:09:24.560,0:09:28.600
and even the one in poell that was uh

0:09:27.360,0:09:31.160
that's the longest I got to talk to

0:09:28.600,0:09:33.600
anyone which was hours and so you were

0:09:31.160,0:09:36.800
on the what the housing hotline no uh no

0:09:33.600,0:09:38.560
I count uh you mean for here uh well why

0:09:36.800,0:09:39.959
would you call po oh because I was

0:09:38.560,0:09:42.279
calling around for any lawyers I could

0:09:39.959,0:09:44.240
find so I've called in and you call the

0:09:42.279,0:09:46.519
legal aid office oh no I did call the

0:09:44.240,0:09:49.120
one in there but I got routed up here uh

0:09:46.519,0:09:50.000
is what it did but uh no the the I

0:09:49.120,0:09:52.079
finally

0:09:50.000,0:09:53.760
after so long of searching I finally

0:09:52.079,0:09:58.000
found one firm that would actually do it

0:09:53.760,0:10:00.240
it's Jason Brown um and we got two hours

0:09:58.000,0:10:03.360
into it and then he goes and looks at

0:10:00.240,0:10:05.800
the past case cuz he pulled it up and uh

0:10:03.360,0:10:08.120
and he goes I hate to say this I've got

0:10:05.800,0:10:09.959
conflict of interest I'm like why well

0:10:08.120,0:10:13.160
he said that uh he had the he had the

0:10:09.959,0:10:16.079
judge over uh the night before at a at a

0:10:13.160,0:10:17.800
party that he had yeah and he said

0:10:16.079,0:10:20.839
remember hearing you talk about that on

0:10:17.800,0:10:22.640
yeah hearing so and then so he he he

0:10:20.839,0:10:25.120
said sorry this conflict of interest he

0:10:22.640,0:10:27.040
said he would they would think about uh

0:10:25.120,0:10:29.079
you know like curating my stuff and just

0:10:27.040,0:10:32.000
going through it and so that way I had

0:10:29.079,0:10:36.040
some advice advisement from anyone but

0:10:32.000,0:10:37.959
he decided it is trust me I'm not is

0:10:36.040,0:10:39.639
what's happening is that lawyers are

0:10:37.959,0:10:42.360
looking at this they don't see that you

0:10:39.639,0:10:43.639
have a legitimate defense to that's

0:10:42.360,0:10:45.040
that's the only problem though is that I

0:10:43.639,0:10:47.120
don't literally I don't get to tell me

0:10:45.040,0:10:48.600
anything about it before I get told this

0:10:47.120,0:10:50.839
so like even here I didn't get to tell

0:10:48.600,0:10:52.800
anything see if you had come to me if I

0:10:50.839,0:10:55.000
was still in private practice I would

0:10:52.800,0:10:56.279
have like looked at it and said if you

0:10:55.000,0:10:58.519
didn't pay your mortgage they can

0:10:56.279,0:11:00.800
foreclose and they can sell now I

0:10:58.519,0:11:04.519
understand you believe a conspiracy to

0:11:00.800,0:11:07.880
defraud you um I get all that but that's

0:11:04.519,0:11:11.200
going to be extremely difficult to prove

0:11:07.880,0:11:12.519
um so uh my guess is that attorneys are

0:11:11.200,0:11:14.600
looking at and say I don't want to waste

0:11:12.519,0:11:16.600
your money because I can't help you but

0:11:14.600,0:11:17.959
they should be telling you that yeah and

0:11:16.600,0:11:20.279
I don't and I don't even get to tell

0:11:17.959,0:11:22.959
them any of the details I I I don't even

0:11:20.279,0:11:24.680
get that far I I and and it's never been

0:11:22.959,0:11:26.440
a thing of money because I mean like I

0:11:24.680,0:11:28.560
said I was going to pay $40,000 for the

0:11:26.440,0:11:30.480
one down in poo because he wanted he

0:11:28.560,0:11:33.200
said he normally do 20,000 but because

0:11:30.480,0:11:35.000
he would have to come up here and that's

0:11:33.200,0:11:36.720
that's how that's how much of a problem

0:11:35.000,0:11:38.000
it's been I mean it's never been about

0:11:36.720,0:11:40.040
money it's never been because I wanted

0:11:38.000,0:11:42.200
to do this on my own well if you had

0:11:40.040,0:11:44.360
come to an attorney back when the

0:11:42.200,0:11:46.680
Foreclosure was getting started you you

0:11:44.360,0:11:49.200
know you had right of redemption yeah I

0:11:46.680,0:11:51.240
tried yeah I tried uh getting a lawyer

0:11:49.200,0:11:52.920
even before then uh I tried to get it

0:11:51.240,0:11:54.880
before then because they were because of

0:11:52.920,0:11:56.800
the frauds that they were doing and

0:11:54.880,0:11:59.000
before they even did the uh the

0:11:56.800,0:12:01.839
Foreclosure or any of that and it just

0:11:59.000,0:12:03.639
got worse and worse as it went um most

0:12:01.839,0:12:06.079
Private Practice lawyers are in just for

0:12:03.639,0:12:08.160
the money yeah they want easy cases that

0:12:06.079,0:12:09.800
they can make a lot of money at they

0:12:08.160,0:12:11.880
don't want to take anything complicated

0:12:09.800,0:12:14.199
like your case I've noticed

0:12:11.880,0:12:16.399
that so did you want to talk about

0:12:14.199,0:12:20.040
something or did you just want well I uh

0:12:16.399,0:12:23.040
wanted to to if you have any idea on any

0:12:20.040,0:12:24.480
lawyers that would be available if you

0:12:23.040,0:12:27.160
knew that they would that wouldn't have

0:12:24.480,0:12:30.079
conflict of interest um I don't have any

0:12:27.160,0:12:32.519
idea who who were wouldn't I have have a

0:12:30.079,0:12:34.680
hard time believing any attorney around

0:12:32.519,0:12:36.560
here has a conflict of interest because

0:12:34.680,0:12:38.839
conflict of interest means they

0:12:36.560,0:12:39.800
represented these people in the past

0:12:38.839,0:12:42.320
that's what I were thinking and I don't

0:12:39.800,0:12:43.600
think the purchasers are local people I

0:12:42.320,0:12:46.839
think they're from out of the area

0:12:43.600,0:12:49.160
they're just investors and so them and

0:12:46.839,0:12:51.320
the mortgage company and all those

0:12:49.160,0:12:53.279
entities there's no attorneys around

0:12:51.320,0:12:56.440
here that's ever represented any of them

0:12:53.279,0:13:00.639
from what so the lady that the uh the

0:12:56.440,0:13:04.360
Morin lady she's one of the uh Gail Gail

0:13:00.639,0:13:06.920
Mor Morin uh she's she's the developer

0:13:04.360,0:13:09.240
that called me ahead uh said that she

0:13:06.920,0:13:12.240
was uh talking with the bank already but

0:13:09.240,0:13:15.199
she was trying to get me to sell to her

0:13:12.240,0:13:17.120
uh ahead of it when she what she told me

0:13:15.199,0:13:19.399
was the reason why uh I wasn't finding a

0:13:17.120,0:13:21.519
lawyer was because the lawyers that do

0:13:19.399,0:13:23.800
the contracts for the mortgages they

0:13:21.519,0:13:25.720
play round Robbin with them and so

0:13:23.800,0:13:26.600
they're not they're not going to do uh

0:13:25.720,0:13:28.800
they're going to have conflict of

0:13:26.600,0:13:30.320
interest because they do the they do the

0:13:28.800,0:13:32.160
cont contracts for the mortgages is at

0:13:30.320,0:13:35.079
least what she told me and any the real

0:13:32.160,0:13:36.839
estate attorneys do that and but that's

0:13:35.079,0:13:39.480
just a few of the local

0:13:36.839,0:13:42.000
attorneys the problem is that the the

0:13:39.480,0:13:43.839
attorneys who don't specialize in real

0:13:42.000,0:13:45.880
estate are going to be scared off your

0:13:43.839,0:13:48.160
case y because they don't really know

0:13:45.880,0:13:50.120
what they're doing I would never take

0:13:48.160,0:13:51.959
your case because it's too complicated

0:13:50.120,0:13:53.680
and that's where that that practice uh

0:13:51.959,0:13:55.360
don't practice in that area that's one

0:13:53.680,0:13:56.759
of the two responses I either get don't

0:13:55.360,0:13:58.839
practice in that area so they do tell

0:13:56.759,0:14:01.279
you that too some of them have told me

0:13:58.839,0:14:03.040
that they don't practice in that area uh

0:14:01.279,0:14:04.519
and then uh the other one is conflict of

0:14:03.040,0:14:06.360
interest so it's either one of the two

0:14:04.519,0:14:07.959
answers I've been getting which is super

0:14:06.360,0:14:09.519
hard I mean it's like okay so if you

0:14:07.959,0:14:11.279
don't practice in that area and I can

0:14:09.519,0:14:14.320
only get ones that are in you know

0:14:11.279,0:14:16.360
that's kind of a uh kind of a problem if

0:14:14.320,0:14:17.880
if people can't get that kind of help so

0:14:16.360,0:14:21.000
you're looking at

0:14:17.880,0:14:23.399
Spokane like that tried Spokane uh I

0:14:21.000,0:14:24.759
mean literally at this point I I'm

0:14:23.399,0:14:28.120
somewhere around

0:14:24.759,0:14:31.279
123 25 uh different firms that I've

0:14:28.120,0:14:33.800
called and this in in Washington Oregon

0:14:31.279,0:14:36.079
and Idaho and from top to Bottoms my

0:14:33.800,0:14:37.800
guess is that lawyers are looking at it

0:14:36.079,0:14:40.040
and saying they're not going to

0:14:37.800,0:14:42.160
foreclose unless it's all done right

0:14:40.040,0:14:44.959
because it's all so heavily regulated

0:14:42.160,0:14:46.560
yeah that um you don't they're going to

0:14:44.959,0:14:49.199
think you don't have a

0:14:46.560,0:14:51.279
defense they don't even listen so yeah

0:14:49.199,0:14:53.440
they don't want to get involved in a

0:14:51.279,0:14:55.519
foreclosure if you don't if they feel

0:14:53.440,0:14:57.320
you don't have a defense yeah so my

0:14:55.519,0:15:00.079
guess is that's what's going

0:14:57.320,0:15:01.759
on and it's going to be very hard to

0:15:00.079,0:15:04.759
convince an attorney that there's some

0:15:01.759,0:15:07.920
conspiracy going on because everybody

0:15:04.759,0:15:09.680
claims conspiracy these days yeah and so

0:15:07.920,0:15:12.199
they think you're a whack job if you if

0:15:09.680,0:15:14.160
you allege there's a conspiracy I'm not

0:15:12.199,0:15:16.800
saying you're a whack job because there

0:15:14.160,0:15:18.199
might be a conspiracy here but I don't

0:15:16.800,0:15:19.880
think any attorney is going to want to

0:15:18.199,0:15:22.399
touch it if they hear that there might

0:15:19.880,0:15:26.120
be because it's so hard to prove yeah

0:15:22.399,0:15:28.160
and the the lucky thing for me is is

0:15:26.120,0:15:30.279
like the Bank of America and uh

0:15:28.160,0:15:33.360
carington they they literally sent me

0:15:30.279,0:15:37.839
paperwork that conflict that admitted to

0:15:33.360,0:15:39.160
it uh uh because one said so Bank of or

0:15:37.839,0:15:43.279
car mortgage was trying to get me to

0:15:39.160,0:15:47.199
sign that backdated uh one in 2022 yeah

0:15:43.279,0:15:49.240
uh and the problem now in your case is

0:15:47.199,0:15:51.399
that all of this stuff would have had to

0:15:49.240,0:15:53.160
have been proven at the time of the

0:15:51.399,0:15:56.319
Foreclosure yeah because now the

0:15:53.160,0:15:57.880
Foreclosure is done property's been sold

0:15:56.319,0:16:00.680
and now they're trying to kick you off

0:15:57.880,0:16:03.800
the property and I don't think you can

0:16:00.680,0:16:05.639
stop why the ejectment why can they do

0:16:03.800,0:16:08.839
why can they I mean because it's they

0:16:05.639,0:16:10.519
admitted to contacting them and which is

0:16:08.839,0:16:12.000
not that's not legal they're not

0:16:10.519,0:16:14.240
supposed to be able to contact the

0:16:12.000,0:16:16.040
trustee for for things why can't they

0:16:14.240,0:16:19.000
admit to that and not get in trouble I

0:16:16.040,0:16:21.199
don't do those types of cases and that's

0:16:19.000,0:16:24.160
what's been confusing is hect toy is

0:16:21.199,0:16:26.800
like if they admitted to a felony it's

0:16:24.160,0:16:29.800
by All rights a felony I I I've triple

0:16:26.800,0:16:31.440
checked this and you're probably right

0:16:29.800,0:16:32.920
but I don't practice in that area of law

0:16:31.440,0:16:35.240
I have to tell you what everybody else

0:16:32.920,0:16:38.759
does we just do family law here and

0:16:35.240,0:16:42.040
housing evictions yeah so and yours is a

0:16:38.759,0:16:44.880
foreclosure it's not an eviction yeah so

0:16:42.040,0:16:47.160
I wish you luck but you're way late in

0:16:44.880,0:16:48.920
the game is what I'm saying because

0:16:47.160,0:16:50.959
proving the conspiracy proving

0:16:48.920,0:16:53.800
wrongdoing all should have happened at

0:16:50.959,0:16:56.519
the Foreclosure stage and before the

0:16:53.800,0:17:00.639
property sale and now all that's been

0:16:56.519,0:17:02.800
done and now as are in the court size

0:17:00.639,0:17:03.920
they're the owners so even though they

0:17:02.800,0:17:07.240
even though they were part of the

0:17:03.920,0:17:10.319
conspiracy there's there it's so

0:17:07.240,0:17:13.000
basically the sale the trustees that did

0:17:10.319,0:17:15.679
the were part of the fraud because they

0:17:13.000,0:17:19.039
were coordinating it and the buyer

0:17:15.679,0:17:20.559
because they they were talking with them

0:17:19.039,0:17:22.720
that legitimizes it just because they

0:17:20.559,0:17:24.160
put it through I'm not saying that okay

0:17:22.720,0:17:27.039
I'm not saying that they should be let

0:17:24.160,0:17:30.440
off the hook I'm saying that the time

0:17:27.039,0:17:34.039
for raising those issues was was months

0:17:30.440,0:17:36.799
and months ago at the at monson's uh

0:17:34.039,0:17:38.679
proceeding yeah when he was for signing

0:17:36.799,0:17:40.200
off on the Foreclosure that's where

0:17:38.679,0:17:42.760
those issues should have come he oh no

0:17:40.200,0:17:44.440
this was a non-judicial uh he we I the

0:17:42.760,0:17:46.440
only reason why we got before mson was

0:17:44.440,0:17:48.240
because I served them trying to get a

0:17:46.440,0:17:50.520
trro to or stay because I didn't know

0:17:48.240,0:17:52.640
which one to do was stay or trro or

0:17:50.520,0:17:53.520
anything like that and so I botched it

0:17:52.640,0:17:55.400
and that's the reason why I got

0:17:53.520,0:17:57.200
dismissed was not because of anything uh

0:17:55.400,0:18:00.440
more than just the fact that I didn't

0:17:57.200,0:18:01.960
serve because the the trustees they said

0:18:00.440,0:18:03.679
that they were in Nevada so I sent it to

0:18:01.960,0:18:05.919
the Nevada office turns out he was

0:18:03.679,0:18:09.760
actually in cordelane but he actually

0:18:05.919,0:18:12.000
had stuff signed in and so I fa all I'm

0:18:09.760,0:18:16.200
saying is that was the time to raise

0:18:12.000,0:18:19.440
these issues now um the Foreclosure is

0:18:16.200,0:18:22.159
done the sale's been done and you're at

0:18:19.440,0:18:25.919
summer judgment stage in the ejectment

0:18:22.159,0:18:27.520
case the only issue before the court is

0:18:25.919,0:18:29.200
whether you should be ejected off the

0:18:27.520,0:18:31.760
property that's the only issue you can't

0:18:29.200,0:18:35.200
bring up conspiracies

0:18:31.760,0:18:39.520
so the people that are committing the

0:18:35.200,0:18:42.880
crime having them eject me is

0:18:39.520,0:18:44.360
not not part of the I mean because

0:18:42.880,0:18:46.320
they're the ones committing the crime so

0:18:44.360,0:18:48.679
why are why isn't that part of the case

0:18:46.320,0:18:51.799
I guess why I don't understand because

0:18:48.679,0:18:54.640
on summary judgment the plaintiff has to

0:18:51.799,0:18:58.400
show that there's no dispute as to any

0:18:54.640,0:19:01.200
material fact uh in in the ejectment

0:18:58.400,0:19:02.600
case uhhuh so the case is limited to

0:19:01.200,0:19:07.230
whether you have a right to stay on the

0:19:02.600,0:19:08.640
property or not and so uh

0:19:07.230,0:19:14.760
[Music]

0:19:08.640,0:19:16.919
your I guess judge Evans might find if

0:19:14.760,0:19:18.720
you properly put into evidence that

0:19:16.919,0:19:20.840
there's some sort of conspiracy I guess

0:19:18.720,0:19:23.240
you could find that they're not properly

0:19:20.840,0:19:26.039
the owners but they've already done the

0:19:23.240,0:19:28.240
foreclosure and so technically the

0:19:26.039,0:19:29.760
Foreclosure the court has to respect the

0:19:28.240,0:19:32.679
foreclosure

0:19:29.760,0:19:37.039
yeah which that part I understand

0:19:32.679,0:19:40.960
and it you know with I'm sorry so it's

0:19:37.039,0:19:40.960
not your fault

0:19:41.200,0:19:45.360
hello I I'm meeting okay I'm meeting

representing Dwayne yeah and um but you

0:20:19.600,0:20:23.880
always have to look at what are the

0:20:21.200,0:20:25.360
issues before the court and the only

0:20:23.880,0:20:26.559
issue before the court right now is

0:20:25.360,0:20:28.400
whether you and Dwayne should be kicked

0:20:26.559,0:20:30.720
off the property am I supposed to do

0:20:28.400,0:20:31.799
have counter claim you could have

0:20:30.720,0:20:35.200
counter

0:20:31.799,0:20:36.799
sued um see there's nowhere online that

0:20:35.200,0:20:39.080
tells you any of this stuff so it's

0:20:36.799,0:20:42.240
that's that's what sucks about this yeah

0:20:39.080,0:20:44.000
because you're just expected to know it

0:20:42.240,0:20:46.000
yeah and if you don't know it then you

0:20:44.000,0:20:48.360
got to get an attorney and the attorneys

0:20:46.000,0:20:50.080
are all turning you down I don't know

0:20:48.360,0:20:51.880
what to tell you because this system

0:20:50.080,0:20:54.440
doesn't work for most

0:20:51.880,0:20:56.080
people yeah and that's frustrating and

0:20:54.440,0:20:59.000
that's why I work at legal a because at

0:20:56.080,0:21:01.200
least I can help people Unlimited types

0:20:59.000,0:21:03.360
of cases yeah but you don't fall into

0:21:01.200,0:21:05.720
those types of cases so it can't help

0:21:03.360,0:21:08.720
you I understand that and that I don't

0:21:05.720,0:21:10.440
like that but that's the reality because

0:21:08.720,0:21:13.240
we don't have real estate experts on

0:21:10.440,0:21:15.559
staff yeah no I understand that we're

0:21:13.240,0:21:17.919
limited by our funding sources our

0:21:15.559,0:21:20.480
funding sources limit us to yeah

0:21:17.919,0:21:23.400
domestic violence family law cases to

0:21:20.480,0:21:25.240
emergency evictions yeah and stuff like

0:21:23.400,0:21:27.760
that which is good work I mean you guys

0:21:25.240,0:21:29.279
you guys are doing for for the good so

0:21:27.760,0:21:31.799
you know I respect

0:21:29.279,0:21:33.720
we're trying yeah so I'm my job is to

0:21:31.799,0:21:35.080
keep Dwayne in that place as long as I

0:21:33.720,0:21:38.400
can and I've done everything I could to

0:21:35.080,0:21:40.720
make sure that he had the best you know

0:21:38.400,0:21:44.120
best chance at at not being screwed over

0:21:40.720,0:21:47.120
because it's because he I mean he's he's

0:21:44.120,0:21:48.640
we had people stalking us and uh and

0:21:47.120,0:21:50.520
everything I mean they would they would

0:21:48.640,0:21:51.640
drive by they would uh stop take

0:21:50.520,0:21:55.120
pictures they would try to come on the

0:21:51.640,0:21:57.559
property everything like that just buker

0:21:55.120,0:22:00.480
stuff these property people are just

0:21:57.559,0:22:02.240
bloodthirsty yeah cuz at this at at one

0:22:00.480,0:22:04.080
point I just want to be like if you if

0:22:02.240,0:22:05.559
you guys were on the up and up then why

0:22:04.080,0:22:06.720
would you have why would you continue

0:22:05.559,0:22:07.960
with this and why would you have

0:22:06.720,0:22:09.520
continue doing this why wouldn't you

0:22:07.960,0:22:11.039
just say you know what I don't want this

0:22:09.520,0:22:13.080
it's going to cost me more money I'm

0:22:11.039,0:22:15.279
going to let go but they don't want as

0:22:13.080,0:22:17.360
much money as they can get and right now

0:22:15.279,0:22:19.440
they want the property so they can flip

0:22:17.360,0:22:21.320
it and make as much money as possible

0:22:19.440,0:22:23.000
which they don't what they buy it for uh

0:22:21.320,0:22:26.159
they bought it for ex for down to the

0:22:23.000,0:22:30.320
penny what the bank said which was

0:22:26.159,0:22:32.440
16345 and 85 lost all the equity all

0:22:30.320,0:22:34.279
yeah well and the house is worth uh is

0:22:32.440,0:22:36.640
worth

0:22:34.279,0:22:39.679
325 and uh and that's part of the

0:22:36.640,0:22:41.799
problem is is and what they don't know

0:22:39.679,0:22:44.600
is that halfway in the middle uh when

0:22:41.799,0:22:46.200
this s started uh I was I was in the

0:22:44.600,0:22:49.360
middle of a renovation the whole top

0:22:46.200,0:22:51.520
half is not livable so I I I've been

0:22:49.360,0:22:53.760
stuck like this for a bit now where I

0:22:51.520,0:22:56.240
can't do anything you know because I

0:22:53.760,0:22:58.120
can't put money into it and you know the

0:22:56.240,0:23:00.000
house doesn't belong to you anymore yeah

0:22:58.120,0:23:02.000
well even even before the sale I

0:23:00.000,0:23:03.559
couldn't do anything I was I putting any

0:23:02.000,0:23:04.880
money into it would have been dumb I was

0:23:03.559,0:23:07.799
trying to get a lawyer trying to figure

0:23:04.880,0:23:09.600
out what to do anding your money exactly

0:23:07.799,0:23:11.200
and so so the top part's gutted so they

0:23:09.600,0:23:13.799
can't flip it you

0:23:11.200,0:23:16.000
know I have no idea whether they

0:23:13.799,0:23:18.760
defrauded you yeah it sounded like they

0:23:16.000,0:23:21.039
were pretty shady yeah they were I don't

0:23:18.760,0:23:23.799
practice in that area of Law and so if

0:23:21.039,0:23:27.279
you can't find an attorney to help you

0:23:23.799,0:23:27.279
um you're screwed

0:23:28.960,0:23:31.159
that

0:23:32.679,0:23:39.080
was I think it was that

0:23:35.760,0:23:41.880
semi hit someone I don't know that was

0:23:39.080,0:23:43.600
definitely yep he must have hit

0:23:41.880,0:23:48.440
something

0:23:43.600,0:23:51.480
huh or his trailer came undone oh my

0:23:48.440,0:23:53.799
God W guy out there doing something to

0:23:51.480,0:23:57.480
it

0:23:53.799,0:24:01.440
yeah yeah we hear all kinds of crashes I

0:23:57.480,0:24:04.039
all the time so I wish I could help you

0:24:01.440,0:24:05.600
but I'm the wrong person well I wanted

0:24:04.039,0:24:07.880
to come down just to see if maybe you

0:24:05.600,0:24:10.039
might have an idea on anyone else that

0:24:07.880,0:24:11.440
would be able to and I and at least the

0:24:10.039,0:24:14.400
very least you

0:24:11.440,0:24:16.120
know I had it's not not like I've never

0:24:14.400,0:24:18.360
wanted a lawyer or like I wanted to do

0:24:16.120,0:24:20.960
this on my own I had the money to and

0:24:18.360,0:24:23.159
yeah have been trying and and it's

0:24:20.960,0:24:25.880
frustrating because at some point it's

0:24:23.159,0:24:27.559
like when is how much money do I have to

0:24:25.880,0:24:29.960
have in order for me to be important

0:24:27.559,0:24:32.880
enough and how much money you know when

0:24:29.960,0:24:35.240
when do I understanding it lawyers are

0:24:32.880,0:24:38.679
lazy they do not want to take on

0:24:35.240,0:24:40.320
complicated cases and only if it's an

0:24:38.679,0:24:42.240
area that they practice in and they're

0:24:40.320,0:24:45.480
able to take the case and they smell a

0:24:42.240,0:24:46.919
lot of money then they'll take it and

0:24:45.480,0:24:48.039
your case they probably think they're

0:24:46.919,0:24:51.720
not going to be able to make enough

0:24:48.039,0:24:53.360
money off you to justify taking the case

0:24:51.720,0:24:54.679
so I don't know what to tell you I wish

0:24:53.360,0:24:57.960
I could tell you different but that's

0:24:54.679,0:24:59.760
the system we have and it stinks yeah

0:24:57.960,0:25:00.880
well I take up much more of your time I

0:24:59.760,0:25:04.880
I just wanted

0:25:00.880,0:25:06.520
to yeah I just wanted to to at least

0:25:04.880,0:25:08.960
it's worth a try to see if there was

0:25:06.520,0:25:10.960
someone that might be able to refer but

0:25:08.960,0:25:13.559
well let's hope that judge Evans finds

0:25:10.960,0:25:15.559
something in what you filed yeah I I

0:25:13.559,0:25:18.279
hope

0:25:15.559,0:25:20.559
uh it sucks because he like the I did

0:25:18.279,0:25:23.159
the shepher report on mine and his and

0:25:20.559,0:25:25.159
he had more errors in his than mine he

0:25:23.159,0:25:29.000
had eight citations that were were

0:25:25.159,0:25:31.080
erroneous out to my four and yeah he

0:25:29.000,0:25:33.159
cast stones at me like you know it's

0:25:31.080,0:25:36.039
like that's his job yeah exactly can't

0:25:33.159,0:25:37.880
take it personally ERS you put the money

0:25:36.039,0:25:40.480
in the slot and they'll say whatever you

0:25:37.880,0:25:42.120
want them to say yeah that's so that's

0:25:40.480,0:25:44.559
why you when he went off on me I don't

0:25:42.120,0:25:47.120
take it personally yeah because that's

0:25:44.559,0:25:48.240
just the way the game is played yeah and

0:25:47.120,0:25:49.960
and yeah I definitely don't take it

0:25:48.240,0:25:51.760
personal I know he's doing his his job

0:25:49.960,0:25:53.480
but at a certain point it's it's

0:25:51.760,0:25:56.080
frustrating because it's

0:25:53.480,0:25:58.559
like you know I mean I'm doing the best

0:25:56.080,0:26:00.600
I can and the judges you know impression

0:25:58.559,0:26:02.480
I get is the judge looks at me like

0:26:00.600,0:26:04.360
you're you're choosing to be prosay

0:26:02.480,0:26:06.120
you're wanting to this you should rise

0:26:04.360,0:26:10.200
to the level and it's like that's not

0:26:06.120,0:26:11.679
that's not the case and uh yeah well

0:26:10.200,0:26:13.320

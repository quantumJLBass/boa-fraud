As far as Bank of Americas go, this one is pretty nice, it has two drive-by ATMs along with a quite a few more drive-by windows than a normal bank. Fast and efficient, I appreciate the additional services offered!

ATMs always seem to have a problem dispensing and accepting cash. Often times there are long lines inside and they have a lower limit of how much cash can be withdrawn from your account in comparison to other locations.

I will say though, the staff are very friendly.

I highly recommend banking with any other bank or credit union out there. I was denied access to my own bank statements, told I couldn‚Äôt dispute a charge I did not authorize until it posted to my account and overdrafted me. Since they couldn‚Äôt dispute it in time, I figure the least they can do is waive the overdraft fee because I did not authorize that charge and I did everything in my power to prevent that from happening but they said ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt guarantee anything, we‚Äôll make a note, however we can offer you a $500 personal loan to prevent an overdraft‚Äù. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!! Absolutely unreal, I‚Äôm closing all accounts with bank of America and will be sure to advise everyone I know to do the same thing.

I never leave reviews but felt like I definitely had to after my experience at this branch. They helped me last minute despite being short staffed and not having an appointment. Not only that, but they were the friendliest! Specifically Lisa and Nina. I‚Äôm so grateful they took the time to help me. I actually have other Bank of America branches closer to my home but I am more than happy to go out of my way to go to this branch from here on out. So thankful for these ladies!

This is the worst bank I have ever been in. I went in there to take care of some of my mothers accounts as she passed away. First you can never get an appointment. Today one of their ‚Äútrainees ‚ÄúMarcella, got in my face for some reason. She claimed I was ‚Äúlooking ‚Äú at her. Looking at her!?! I was already under enough stress having to deal with my moms passing, then I had to put up with this women‚Äôs extreme rudeness. She needs to take a course in people skills.
I hope I don‚Äôt ever have to go in this establishment again

Opened new account, was in portland for work, called this branch as it is where I opened my account and staff was more than willing to transfer me to corporate knowing I have no information to get through automated system. Thanks for not helping me, I will weigh whether I want to continue to bank with your bank now. Wish I would have read these reviews prior to using this location,  as I believe your home branch should be the place you reach out for help, not some corporate office I have never spoke with. Call me old fashion but where is the customer service?? I think they need to demote the managers here and make Monina a manager as she is the only helpful person at this location as far as I can tell.

There always seems to be an issue every time I come here. Today, I‚Äôve been waiting for over an hour for a notary. Upon arrival, they told me the wait was ten minutes. They just came out and said it would be another half hour.

Apparently they only have one notary, and she just so happens to be the same person who hides out in the vault all day. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Worst bank I have ever visited. The tellers do their best and are very nice. However there is a line of 10 people almost every visit. Management walks around as if they dont care that people are waiting 30 minutes plus to simply deposit a business check. They never jump behind the teller window and help out. If my store ran like this, I would be fired in a week

Only 2 employees ever on at one time.
Worst service ever.
Was asked if I want an account here...
Tell me why would I do that?
Looks like all other reviews say about the same on here. Corporate should re assess this place.

I have been trying to call them as they were out of check book registry books and I don't want to go out in the rain only to find out they still don't have them. Have checks to write and they are only one open on Saturday. No one picks up phone. Have called and called. Ordered over phone to be mailed but will take at least 2 weeks. I'm 77 and cannot drive from Bank to bank searching for a registry book. Very bad service for a customer of 37 years.

Constantly a long wait, expect to spend 15-20 minutes in line every time you come here. Also expect to see a bunch of useless people walking back and forth while one or two tellers deal with the rush.  Edit: going on two years with the same experience, wish I could avoid this bank at all costs but my landlord uses it.  Will be in this line for 30 minutes with their one teller working during rush hour.... this branch is horrible.

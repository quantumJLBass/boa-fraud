This detailed summary consolidates key material facts, legal precedents, and procedural irregularities surrounding the trustee’s sale of Jeremy Bass’s property at 1515 21st Avenue, Lewiston, Idaho. It emphasizes that multiple defects, if true, render the sale void ab initio, precluding any rights to transfer or protect subsequent purchasers.

### **1. Fundamental Issues Invalidating the Sale**

The trustee sale conducted on February 29, 2024, suffers from multiple substantive and procedural defects that collectively render it void from inception. Defendant Jeremy Bass highlights several factors that invalidate the sale under Idaho law, asserting that no rights could transfer to the Plaintiffs due to these flaws.

1. **No Valid Default**:
	1. Defendant contends that no default existed, as part performance of verbal agreements with the mortgage servicer effectively nullified foreclosure proceedings. Payments toward property taxes and insurance were made as part of an agreement to resolve the debt, making the foreclosure unauthorized under Idaho Code.
2. **Wrong Instrument Used**:
	1. The foreclosure relied on an incorrect or incomplete instrument, contradicting statutory requirements. Discrepancies between recorded instruments and the documents used in the foreclosure undermine the legal foundation of the sale.
3. **Collusion and Bid Rigging**:
	1. Plaintiffs, in coordination with the trustee, engaged in pre-auction arrangements to manipulate bidding outcomes. Evidence includes pre-printed checks matching bid amounts and prior communications discussing the auction process. Such actions violate the principles of fair and open bidding required under Idaho law.
4. **Breach of Trustee Obligations**:
	1. The trustee failed to act impartially, allowing a sale tainted by collusion and irregularities. The trustee’s conduct violated fiduciary duties, rendering the sale fundamentally flawed.
5. **Procedural Irregularities**:
	1. The sale did not adhere to Idaho Code requirements, such as providing transparent notice of auction terms and ensuring competitive bidding. These procedural defects, if proven, independently invalidate the sale.

### **2. Title Chain and Recording Issues**

Defendant asserts that the title chain contains significant defects that cast doubt on the Plaintiffs’ claim to ownership:

1. **Letter of Full Reconveyance**:
	1. A Letter of Full Reconveyance was recorded in 2009, reflecting satisfaction of the original loan. This document is the last undisputed and properly recorded instrument in the chain of title. Any subsequent foreclosure action would need to address this reconveyance, but the Plaintiffs’ claim bypasses its implications entirely.
2. **Unrecorded and Contradictory Instruments**:
	1. The instrument purportedly authorizing the foreclosure was not properly recorded, and its terms conflict with previously recorded documents. Idaho Code § 55-809 requires all instruments affecting real property to be recorded; failure to comply undermines the validity of subsequent transactions.
3. **Break in Chain of Title**:
	1. Plaintiffs claim title through a trustee’s deed following the February 29, 2024, auction. However, Defendant alleges that the sale was void due to procedural and substantive defects, meaning no valid title could have passed. Without a valid transfer, the Plaintiffs’ claim lacks legal foundation.

### **3. Judicial Precedents Supporting Void Sale**

Defendant relies on case law to argue that the sale is void from inception, precluding any transfer of rights to the Plaintiffs:

1. **Void Ab Initio Doctrine**:
	1. _Taylor v. Just_ establishes that foreclosure sales failing to comply with statutory requirements are void ab initio. A void sale has no legal effect and cannot confer title to purchasers, regardless of their good faith or payment of value.
2. **Good Faith Purchaser Protections Limited**:
	1. _Baker v. Nationstar_ clarifies that protections for bona fide purchasers under Idaho Code § 45-1508 do not extend to sales marred by substantive defects, such as fraud or lack of default. Plaintiffs’ knowledge of defects disqualifies them from claiming these protections.
3. **Material Irregularities**:
	1. _Spencer v. Jameson_ holds that foreclosure sales can be invalidated based on material irregularities, regardless of whether harm to the grantor is demonstrated. Defendant’s evidence of bid rigging, collusion, and procedural violations supports such a finding.
4. **Trustee Duties and Fair Auctions**:
	1. Idaho law, reinforced by decisions like _Idaho Power v. Benj. Houseman_, requires trustees to conduct auctions impartially and in good faith. Any deviation, such as allowing pre-arranged bids, voids the sale.

### **4. Multiple Independent Grounds for Void Sale**

Several independent issues, each sufficient to render the sale void, highlight the severity of the defects:

1. **Lack of Default**:
	1. Foreclosure sales require a valid default. If no default existed due to part performance or errors in servicing, the foreclosure and sale are unauthorized.
2. **Collusion and Bid Manipulation**:
	1. Pre-auction coordination, including pre-printed checks and prior discussions between Plaintiffs and the trustee, violated the principles of competitive bidding. Such actions breach antitrust laws and invalidate the sale.
3. **Improper Use of Instruments**:
	1. Using incorrect or conflicting instruments undermines the legal basis of the foreclosure, voiding subsequent transactions.
4. **Procedural Non-Compliance**:
	1. The trustee sale failed to meet statutory requirements for transparency, notice, and bidding practices, independently voiding the sale.
5. **Break in Title Chain**:
	1. Plaintiffs’ claim to title is based on a void trustee’s deed, leaving them without legal ownership. A defective title chain precludes enforcement of any claims derived from the sale.

### **5. Broader Legal Implications**

Defendant alleges violations of state and federal laws that further undermine Plaintiffs’ claims:

1. **Antitrust Violations**:
	1. Collusion and bid manipulation breach the Sherman Antitrust Act, which prohibits agreements that restrain trade or suppress competition in auctions. These violations necessitate federal jurisdiction and invalidate the auction results.
2. **Trustee Misconduct**:
	1. The trustee’s failure to act impartially breaches fiduciary duties, exposing all parties to legal liabilities. Such misconduct invalidates the foreclosure and subsequent sale.
3. **Impact on Public Auctions**:
	1. The alleged irregularities compromise the integrity of public auctions, undermining their purpose as transparent and competitive processes.

### **6. Relief Sought**

Defendant seeks:

1. Reconsideration of the court’s summary judgment ruling under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 11.2(b).
2. A stay of enforcement pending reconsideration and appeal.
3. Invalidation of the trustee’s sale based on procedural and substantive defects.
4. Recognition that Plaintiffs cannot claim bona fide purchaser status.
5. Dismissal or transfer of the case to federal court due to antitrust violations.

### **Conclusion**

The trustee sale of 1515 21st Avenue is void due to multiple defects, including lack of default, collusion, procedural violations, and breaks in the title chain. Plaintiffs’ claims are unsupported by valid title or legal protections, as the sale had no legal effect from inception. Defendant urges the court to revisit its judgment, emphasizing the principles of statutory compliance, fair auctions, and property rights.

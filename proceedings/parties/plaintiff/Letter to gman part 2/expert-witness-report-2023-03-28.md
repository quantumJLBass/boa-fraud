BASS, Plaintiff, vs. MICHAEL J. NEWELL, c/o IDEA Law Group, LLC, ESQ, CARRINGTON MORTGAGE SERVICES, LLC, BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., RECONTRUST COMPANY, N.A., DOE I-X Defendants. Case No. CV35221875 EXPERT WITNESS REPORT OF JEREMY L. BASS DEMAND FOR JURY 9 10 COMES NOW Plaintiff, JEREMY L. BASS, to present an Expert 11 Witness Report. Pursuant to the Federal Rules of Evidence 702, 12 I, Jeremy L. Bass, Pro Se, submit this Expert Witness Report to 13 provide my expert opinion on the authenticity of the signature 14 in question, which is purportedly mine, in connection with the 15 Amended Complaint in the referenced case. 16 17 I. Qualifications and Expertise 18 19 EXPERT WITNESS REPORT OF JEREMY L. BASS PAGE 2 As a recognized expert in digital technologies and graphic 1 arts, my 30-year career has provided me with extensive 2 experience in areas such as forensic document examination, 3 digital forensics, and signature analysis. My curriculum vitae 4 (CV), attached as EXHIBIT AC, demonstrates my professional 5 achievements, including high-profile collaborations and a 6 history of working with sensitive financial and emergency 7 systems. My expertise is further evidenced by my tenure as the 8 Lead Senior Full Stack DevSecOps for Finance and Administration 9 at Washington State University. 10 11 II. Scope of Investigation and Methodology 12 To determine the authenticity of the questioned signature, 13 I conducted a comprehensive examination using the following 14 industry-standard methods: 15 16 1. Visual inspection and magnification of the original 17 document(s) containing the signature in question; 18 2. Comparative analysis of the questioned signature with 19 multiple known genuine signatures; 20 3. Assessment of signature characteristics, such as slant, pen 21 pressure, and letter formation; 22 4. Evaluation of the presence or absence of natural variation; 23 EXPERT WITNESS REPORT OF JEREMY L. BASS PAGE 3 5. Utilization of advanced digital forensic tools to detect 1 signs of tampering or manipulation. 2 3 III. Expert Opinion and Analysis 4 Upon completion of the investigation, I have formed the 5 following expert opinion based on the gathered evidence and my 6 expertise in signature analysis: 7 8 The questioned signature is highly likely not authentic and 9 may be a forgery. The signature exhibits several significant 10 discrepancies when compared to my known genuine signatures, 11 including but not limited to: 12 13 1. The slant of the signature differs markedly from the 14 consistent slant observed in my genuine signatures; 15 2. The strokes in the questioned signature is inconsistent 16 and lacks the uniformity found in my authentic signatures; 17 3. The formation of certain letters in the questioned 18 signature deviates from the established patterns observed 19 in my genuine signatures; Most notably the ‘B’ 20 4. The questioned signature lacks the natural variation that 21 is expected and consistently present in my genuine 22 signatures. 23 EXPERT WITNESS REPORT OF JEREMY L. BASS PAGE 4 1 In addition to the above discrepancies, my digital forensic 2 examination uncovered signs of potential tampering or 3 manipulation within the document containing the questioned 4 signature. Notable is that the signatures are highly pixelated, 5 more so then any surrounding text and the signature lines have a 6 break which can happen when a digital copy paste is done as a 7 white ‘halo’ will sometime be present on bad cropping or 8 pasting. Although that is not a great indicator on its own it 9 does add to the mountain of tells in these signatures purported 10 to be Mr. Bass’ own hand that produced them. These findings 11 raise serious concerns about the authenticity of the signature 12 and the integrity of the document as a whole. 13 14 The most damming aspect of the signature in question is that 15 there is no `a` in the last name. It’s appearance is very much 16 looking like `Bss`. Mr. Bass is very confident in the fact that 17 he knows how to spell his last name. His father gave it to him, 18 passed down from generations, too far back to trace; he may 19 never make it famous, but he'll never bring it shame, it's his 20 last name. 21 22 IV. Conclusion 23 EXPERT WITNESS REPORT OF JEREMY L. BASS PAGE 5 Based on the thorough examination, comparative analysis, 1 and application of my expertise in signature and document 2 analysis, I conclude that the questioned signature is highly 3 likely not authentic and may be a forgery. This conclusion is 4 supported by the substantial discrepancies observed between the 5 questioned signature and my known genuine signatures, as well as 6 the potential tampering or manipulation detected in the 7 document. The only way to refute this analysis is for an 8 examination of the wet inked copy to be carried out. 9 10 In accordance with the Daubert Standard, which has been 11 adopted in Idaho and governs the admissibility of expert 12 testimony, my expert opinion is based on relevant and reliable 13 methods, procedures, and principles that are generally accepted 14 within the field of signature and document analysis. 15 Furthermore, the General Electric Co. v. Joiner and Kumho Tire 16 Co. v. Carmichael cases emphasize the role of trial judges as 17 gatekeepers in determining the admissibility of expert 18 testimony, including both scientific and non-scientific expert 19 evidence. 20 21 Under Federal Rules of Evidence 704(a), my expert opinion 22 is offered to assist the trier of fact in this case and is not 23 EXPERT WITNESS REPORT OF JEREMY L. BASS PAGE 6 objectionable simply because it embraces an ultimate issue. It 1 is important to note that the ultimate determination of whether 2 the signature is authentic or forged will be made by the judge 3 or jury. 4 5 V. Disclosure of Facts, Data, and Expert Witness Discovery 6 7 In compliance with IRCP 26(b)(5) and Federal Rules of 8 Evidence 705, I have disclosed the following information to 9 facilitate the discovery process for expert witnesses: 10 11 1. My qualifications, including my curriculum vitae (CV), 12 which provides a detailed account of my education, work 13 experience, and professional accomplishments (attached as 14 EXHIBIT AC). 15 16 2. The subject matter of my testimony, which pertains to the 17 authenticity of the questioned signature, its comparison 18 with known genuine signatures, and the detection of any 19 potential tampering or manipulation in the document. 20 21 3. A summary of the facts and data underlying my expert 22 opinion, including the methods and procedures used in my 23 EXPERT WITNESS REPORT OF JEREMY L. BASS PAGE 7 investigation, such as visual inspection, magnification, 1 comparative analysis, assessment of signature 2 characteristics, and digital forensic tools. 3 4 In accordance with Federal Rules of Evidence 705, I am 5 prepared to disclose the specific facts or data underlying my 6 expert opinion during my testimony, should the court or opposing 7 counsel require further clarification or elaboration. 8 9 This Expert Witness Report is submitted in conjunction with 10 the Amended Complaint and supporting documents filed in the case 11 of J.Bass v. BoA, Case No. CV35221875. Please do not hesitate to 12 contact me if you need additional information or clarification 13 regarding the disclosure of facts, data, and expert witness 14 discovery in connection with my Expert Witness Report. 15 16 Dated this _24___ day of March 2023.

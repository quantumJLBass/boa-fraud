These people are thieves. They are happy to engage in shady collection practices for east coast clients not bothering to check and see if the statute of limitations has been met, if people have been served with a chance to respond, or if there are circumstances requiring the common courtesy of a phone call or letter. Happy to levy bank accounts and clear out your funds with NO warning whatsoever and then “give you the opportunity to dispute”.  They are credits to their profession. Which ain’t saying a lot.

My husband and I paid for services for Smith Law Firm on a real estate escrow account. Our information was shared with another client they represented for a debt collection. I have also worked in the legal field for years with some of the state's top firms and lawyers and I have 4 years of law school behind me. I know the privacy of keeping clients information confidential. My husband was also a running candidate in Montana. To share our personal information to represent a client to collect a debt on us is unethical. When we called to speak about the issue, we were told (rudely) that we never paid for services (which I have receipt) that they never shared our bank information, but didn’t deny that they are representing the client against us, in fact ask how we can settle the debt. I will be filing a complaint with ODC and up and will continue until disciplinary act is met.

Response from the owner 4 years ago
This reviewer and her husband were not clients of our firm and we dispute their intentionally inaccurate review. We cannot respond further due to privacy and confidentially obligations to our actual clients.

Met with attorney for 30 mins to have some simple paperwork drawn up and was told he would email me a draft. Nothing came. Followed up with phone call and my call wasn’t returned. I have no idea what happened.

We went here to close on our new condo.  They were extremely professional and thoroughly went over all documents and answered all of our questions in detail.  Very friendly people and a real joy to work with.  They made what would have otherwise been a very stressful experience easy and seamless.  I'm so happy they're handling the escrow for our condo.  I would highly recommend! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

We were supposed to have our down payment from our rental wired to our account 10/25 at the latest, and they have had the funds since 10/21. Both of our realtors and the co-owner have tried to reach Bill several times. He will not return calls after dozens of attempts. We were told we "needed to be patient", and that we would have it by the end of the day 11/3. It is now 11/5 and we still don't have those funds OR our monthly rent payment, as well as our pro-rated rent for the end of October. This is highly unprofessional and absolutely unwarranted, Bill. We have a mortgage to pay, and we will not be liable for any late fees incurred. You told us when we closed on that house that "if you don't pay your mortgage, you don't keep your house!", yet you are making it impossible for us to do so because you will not wire our funds to us, which is over $12k at this point.

We have closed 3 different times with HA&TCO.  They are friendly, and take every question or concern you may have seriously. Everyone there seems happy to be there. That takes good management. I strongly recommend.

Wow. As a solo interest, left messages and NEVER got a return phone call in consideration. I found what I was looking for from another title company in Helena. Maybe they're good for their base clients, not so good at simple community personal requests? Disappointed.

If we had to do it again we would choose a different title company. The folks at Hatco are nice, but they held our money after closing so beware.  Our buyers closed at 9:30am on Monday, we closed at 10am.  The closer told us she would wire the money to our account, a very large amount, by noon on Monday.  She did not do this.  She didn't get it done until late Tuesday afternoon so we did not get the money until Wednesday.   Just the interest on this 2 day lag was $150+.  She did not contact us to advise of the delay.  This appears to be an intentional tactic by Hatco.  Regardless of the intentions, it is very unprofessional, likely illegal, and cost us money.  Very disappointing!!

It took 2 days and multiple phone calls to get our Helena Abstract and Title rep ( Reagan Worm) to finally wire our funds.  She called back the first day to apologize, that she'd forgotten to wire our house sale funds to our bank account. On the second day, we never got a call back, but funds were finally wired to our account. When you are involved with a home sale and large amounts of money, the last thing you should have to do is keep calling HAAT to do their job. I will never work with them again. Poor service, and poor follow through.

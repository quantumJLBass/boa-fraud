COMES NOW the Plaintiff, JEREMY L. BASS, and respectfully moves this Court for the following:

To allow the Plaintiff to amend its pleading as a matter of course for the proceedings over the property located at 1515 21ST AVE. LEWISTON ID 83501-3926 (hereinafter "THE PROPERTY" or "HOUSE" fully described in further reading).

To reconsider its Order on Motions for Reconsideration dated March 9, 2023, which denied Plaintiff's Request for a Temporary Restraining Order and Motion for Reconsideration.

As grounds for these requests, the Plaintiff respectfully asks the Court to review the following arguments and legal authorities in support of the Plaintiff's requests.

I. Request to Amend Pleading

Authority to grant the motion for reconsideration roots from Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 11.2(b)(1).

The Plaintiff believes that they have addressed the need for actionable or triable pleadings and is committed to rectifying any shortcomings in the process. It is not the Plaintiff's intent to make a mockery of the court's time or resources. With hundreds of hours of research invested in understanding how to protect the investment in THE PROPERTY, the Plaintiff is doing their best to present a cogent and well-reasoned argument to the Court.

The Plaintiff acknowledges the challenge of proceeding pro se due to a lack of access to legal representation stemming from conflicts of interest with local law firms practicing real estate or contract law. Despite the inherent disadvantage faced by the Plaintiff, they are dedicated to meeting the Court's expectations and ensuring procedural compliance.

The Plaintiff would also like to highlight the vast disparity in litigation capacity between a pro se litigant and a practicing attorney, emphasizing the inherent inequity that tends to favor the more affluent. The Plaintiff's extensive self-guided research, while commendable, pales in comparison to the education and experience of a professional attorney, and this serves as a reminder of the handicaps faced by those compelled to represent themselves.

The Plaintiff would also like to acknowledge the significant amount of time and effort required to conduct forensics and post-mortem analysis on such a complex and nuanced issue, which spans multiple areas of law and involves the blatant and nonchalant exploitation of the legal system. As a pro se litigant acting primarily in defense against the commencement of alleged fraudulent actions, either in league with or enacted through the position of the trustee and by way of the abuse of process, the Plaintiff is striving to untangle this intricate web and bring the matter to a just resolution.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court allow the amendment of the complaint, provide any necessary guidance to ensure procedural compliance, and acknowledge the challenges faced by the Plaintiff as a pro se litigant striving for a just resolution in this case.

II. Request for Reconsideration and Temporary Restraining Order

The Court found that Plaintiff's motion did not adequately comply with the requirements set forth in I.R.C.P. 65. In response, the Plaintiff submits that they have now met the requirements of I.R.C.P. 65 by providing additional details on the timelines and identifying a new party, ReconTrust Company, N.A., in their proposed amended complaint.

The Plaintiff cites the United States v. Webb, 655 F.2d 977, 979 (9th Cir. 1981), which states that a court must be guided by the underlying purpose of Rule 15--to facilitate a decision on the merits rather than on the pleadings or technicalities. As such, the Court should

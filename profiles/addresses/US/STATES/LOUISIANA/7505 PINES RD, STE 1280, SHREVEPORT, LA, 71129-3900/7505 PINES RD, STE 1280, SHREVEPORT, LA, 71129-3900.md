Leeonnas is an amazing person, I love his positive spirit. I remember when he first started working with my son on getting his home financed. I asked him, so you're the one that will try to get my son finance. His reply was, NO I'm the one that will get him financed. We went through some road blocks a couple of times, but we hung in there and and Praise God in April 2024 my son closed on his first home. Thank you Leeonnas for all your hard work and pushing him not to give up!

Leeonnas Richardson has truly displayed the definition of what excellent Customer Service should be!  Back in May, I reached out to Mr.  Richardson, seeking his assistance in helping my client obtain her first home. From that initial contact, to closing, Mr. Richardson was there to guide my client through the home buying process, not missing a beat!

I then reached out to him again in November to assist with another client I was working with. And again, he conveyed top-notch professionalism!!  He assisted my client by ensuring she obtained her dream home and was available to answer any questions we had, no matter the time of day!!

I would highly recommend Mr. Richardson to anyone who is in the market to buy a house!  You won't be disappointed!!

Special thanks to Leeonnas Richardson for helping me become a first time homebuyer. He was very helpful in answering all questions that I had and guiding me through this process. Although, it got a little overwhelming at times he was very encouraging and made time to talk when needed. Overall he made this experience every bit of amazing! 10/10 I highly recommend.

Earlier this year my husband and I took on the task of building a custom home. As interest rates increased, so did our anxiety with worries of affordability.  Leeonnas put our minds at ease when he was able to lock in an affordable interest rate despite market volatility.  His knowledge, expertise and professionalism is unmatched.  Can't thank him enough for how he seamlessly walked us through the buying process.  He really helped make our family's dream a reality!  We love our new home!

From the moment we submitted our application as first-time homebuyers, Leeonnas has been an invaluable support. He consistently responded promptly to our calls and messages, demonstrating a level of dedication that exceeded our expectations. Having him in our corner truly made a significant impact, and thanks to his expertise and commitment, we successfully closed on our new home within just two weeks.

Mr. Richardson was a carefully placed piece of a missing part of this puzzle called "home ownership." He provided all the borders, filled in the empty spaces so I could see a clear picture. His service is provided basically 24/7. Anytime I text or called the response was immediate. He is about his business and his priority is his clients. He makes it happen!!  There were some documents I had not submitted prior to closing on my house. He was very helpful and walked me through the process of submitting said documents to get me to closing!! He calms your fears and makes you feel comfortable in your decision. I appreciate everything he has done and will continue to do for me and my family!!   I'm tired of this third party stuff!! You are amazing!! I appreciate you beyond imagination!! Thank you!!

Mr. Leeonnas was wonderful to work with.  He helped my mom purchase her first home.  He was knowledgeable and patient with us through the whole process. As a first time homebuyer, my mom was completely overwhelmed by the process and the terminology that is used nowadays but he was able to get us through while staying positive and patient.  It's so important to work with someone who stays positive and has the patience to break the process and terminology down for clients who need the extra help.  You can tell he juggles a lot and is comfortable in multitasking, which made us feel more comfortable.  We are very greatful!

If you're in the market for a home, Cross Country Equity, LLC is a great option to consider. My personal Loan Officer, Mr. Leeonnas Richardson, made the loan process a breeze. From start to finish, he was professional, prompt, and knowledgeable. Mr. Richardson had a wealth of information to share about the loan process and was always available to answer any questions that I had. He was able to guide me through each step of the process, and I felt well-informed and confident throughout.  He was also able to secure me a competitive interest rate, which was a huge relief. Overall, I had an excellent experience working with Cross Country Equity, LLC and Mr. Leeonnas Richardson. I would highly recommend this company to anyone looking for a home loan. The professionalism, expertise, and customer service was truly amazing!

We had the absolute best experience purchasing our home through Cross Country Equity, LLC. Our personal Loan Officer was Mr. Leeonnas Richardson.  He was very professional, respectful, and the young man is one of the smartest financial officers we have ever dealt with during any financial transactions we have made throughout our lives.  Leeonnas understands that the home loan process is stressful and requires a lot of paperwork that can sometimes be difficult to understand.  So , not only would he send us an email explaining every document he would send to us, but, he called us prior to sending the emailed documents to explain to us exactly what each document contained and how we were to proceed in completing them as well. Every time we called Leeonnas with questions (which was a lot), he responded immediately.  In addition to the wonderful things we have already said about Leeonnas, the best and most important attributes he possesses are his honesty, his ability to keep his word, and to always follow through on everything that he said he would do for us.  The qualities that Leeonnas possesses are very rare in the world today, especially in the financial industry.  Overall, we have absolutely no complaints about our experiences with Leeonnas and Cross Country Equity.  In fact, we highly recommend them to anyone interested in purchasing a home in this stressful homebuyer's market.

Thank you Leeonnas and Cross Country Equity, LLC.  It was a pleasure doing business with you.

Leeonnas was very informative, always remained professional, open line of communication, answered every question that I had plus some, and always kept me encouraged when I began to have doubts.

I've will always recommended him for mortgage financing. He will make the experience most definitely a memorable one!

My lending officer, Leeonnas Richardson was truly amazing and such a blessing. Even before I actually applied for my home loan, he was very responsive and helpful with any concerns or questions I had. Once I applied and was approved for my loan he was there to answer any questions and encouraging every step of the way while I was searching for a home in a competitive market. He truly worked overtime to get everything approved and processed in a timely manner. The most important attribute Mr. Richardson possesses is that he genuinely cares about the customer's individual needs and concerns. I truly believe he's very passionate about each and every customer.  I highly recommend. And I look forward to working with Mr. Richardson in the future.

I had the pleasure of working with Leeonnas Richardson. He was very professional and helped make the home buying process much smoother than I had imagined. I live in TX and he was able to help me across state lines and even drove from LA to be present for my closing in TX. If you're looking for a mortgage professional you can not go wrong with Cross Country Equity.

This is my first time purchasing a home and Mr. Richardson made the process go very smooth.  He provided excellent service and explained everything thoroughly to me.  The process was quick and easy and he provided my approvals fast. Any issues I had with the builder (and we had some issues with them), he navigated them to alleviate stress on my end.  I would definitely recommend him to anyone looking to purchase a home.

We had the pleasure of working with Leeonnas Richardson with the purchase of our new home. We attempted to go through another lender but they would have taken to long so we found Mr. Richardson. Not only was he able to get our loan processed weeks sooner than the other lender, he found us a better rate. He is quick to respond to any issues or concerns we had. He also gave us plenty of resources to assist with the process along the way. We couldn't have been happier to work with him with the purchase of our new home and will absolutely use him in the future!

Leeonnas was my lender and I am currently a 25 y/o First time Home buyer. I was nervous going into the home buying process but Leeonnas' professionalism and knowledge was what I needed to quell any fears. He was always open for questions any time of the day and very timely in his responses. On top of locking in a low rate earlier on, he was also doing the behind the scenes work of finding first time home buying programs that practically cut my cost in half. If you're looking for a lender either experienced or it is your first time, Leeonnas and Cross Country Equity is the way to go! Thank you!

Hands down, the best mortgage specialist out there! We have worked with Cross Country since purchasing our very first home and since then we have returned to Cross Country for several additional properties. Every single time, the experience has been excellent which is why we will continue to return. Communication is prompt and professional. Mr. Richardson not only provides excellent service, he also makes sure you walk away with knowledge about the process and decisions that are being made. I would highly recommend Cross Country to anyone who is purchasing property.

Leeonnas gave my wife and I such an amazing experience throughout this whole process with purchasing our first home. He is truly dedicated to providing the best services he can and made our home buying process a one to remember, in a positive way. We heard so many scary stories when purchasing a home, however, working with Leeonnas honestly felt like one of the easiest processes we have ever had to go through. He was very detailed, timely, and prompt with responses and made sure we knew everything possible before we agreed to anything. He was very quick to get back with us with any questions we had and also easy to communicate with. I will defiantly recommend him for anyone trying to buy a home and know that he will not disappoint! Thank you again Leeonnas!!!!

Mr. Leeonnas and the Cross Country team provided valuable information and unwavering support throughout my home buying process. I am confident that I received the best rates and the entire process was stress free and expeditious. When I needed help or had a series of questions, Leeonnas was always available. His work ethic and commitment to making his clients feel valued is non-comparable. I would most definitely work with them again.

Mr. Leeonnas (Mortgage Broker) from Cross Country Equity, LLC was excellent at making sure my home loan was processed in a timely manner. He went an extra mile in ensuring that all my documents were processed upfront by the underwriter to avoid any last minute surprises. Highly recommend his expertise towards a home loan. I give him 5 star for his hard work, dedication and following through on every single detail. Thank you, Mr. Leeonnas for getting me & my family into my new home.

He made every step clear from start to finish and we were 100% comfortable with our decisions when it was done. Cross Country Equity is the best choice in this industry.

Omggg!!!!Where do I start. I've had one of the best experiences of my entire life. I contacted Leeonnas on January 28th to start my homeowners process. I submitted an application on the same day and he had an approval on February 3rd. Leeonnas was very attentive to my needs, and also stayed in contract with me throughout the entire process. Leeonnas worked around the clock as I would get emails from him at midnight, 1am, 2am 3am ect. Leeonnas was very transparent about everything, he also worked on weekends as well. I would refer him a thousand time over and over again. Throughout the process he kept reassuring me I would be in my home, and on April 14th I became a homeowner for the first time thanks to Leeonnas he is definitely the bomb. And lastly he remained professional at all times. So, if you are reading this review stop here and call I promise you will not be disappointed.

He helped me understand the process every step of the way and made sure to stay in contact with all parties within the transaction to assure that my loan went thru smoothly. I would definitely recommend using him for your home purchase or refinance.

The BEST mortgage broker that I've dealt with. Leeonnas Richardson is phenomenal. I appreciate the fact that when he submits files they are well put together. My underwriters love working with him because they know that he submits complete loans with ALL the documentation needed for a clear to close. If you're looking for a mortgage broker look no further, it is so important to work with a broker that is knowledgeable, experienced and detail oriented like Leeonnas.

Leeonas and his team was a pleasure to work with. They took the fear out of buying a home. I've started this process a few times over the years and never crossed the finish line due to the process seeming so long, difficult and scary. Well after 20 years thanks to Leeonas and his team I am now a home owner! Leeonas went above and beyond to help and to answer questions and to clarify when needed to help streamline this process and get me closed quickly. If you're looking for someone that really takes pride in what they do and that will put you first then contact Leeonas and his team today.

We had applied with several mortgage companies but Mr. Richardson was the only one to offer three times more than anyone else. No matter the question he always had an answer and no was never an option! If he said he could get it done he did. This was our first time buying a house and at closing the selling agent requested his information. she stated this was the first time a lender ever closed so quickly. We are in Love with our new home and recommend Mr. Richardson for all Mortgage needs.

My experience with Leeonas Richardson was amazing. He was my loan officier between the time of January 2021 to Feb 2022. He was the man behind the plan that made it happened. He is a spiritual-centered person that will verbally say, "God will do it" when any adversity appears. He was always respectful, polite, and a gentleman to say the least. I would greet him on a first name basis but he would never do that in return. He ALWAYS greeted me with a title and then my last name. He was a true professional all the time. He will work late hours to get the job done. He will research, provide, and recommend resources for you that you need to make buying a home a smooth transition. In the end, he will make time to support you by attending the closing. In conclusion, it was a pleasure to have such a patient and hard working person being apart of this life changing event for me.

Leeonnas is AMAZING! My husband and I had such a swift easy breezy experience during this entire process! I remember him from being at a vast majority of our Realtors open houses and being just as personable and accommodating then as he was during our home buying process! I remember on our closing day how genuinely happy he was for us and I quote he said "Congratulations #TeamMcNear you guys have a beautiful first home and a heck of a first home at that!  He is truly dedicated to providing the best experience and taking the stress, worry, and fear away. When we first began our journey we were so nervous and didn't know what to expect however, working with Leeonnas honestly felt like a walk in the park. He was very detailed oriented, responsive, timely, accurate, and prompt. He made sure we knew everything we needed to know before we agreed to anything. He explained what we were signing and why and mentioned on numerous occasions that if we didn't understand something call him and he would explain and ease our fears. He was a pleasure to communicate with and did I mention personable ?! Even after the home buying process he is still available to answer any questions we have. I will recommend him and our realtor to anyone trying to buy a home, property, or anywhere his services can be rendered! Very professional! Oh and did I mention he blessed us with a heck of a housewarming gift!  Thank you so much Leeonnas! We typically don't say this to people we do business with but you have become family! We love you man! We wish many blessings to you and yours!

Buying a home can be a very stressful time when common terms and stages, of the process, are not understood by the buyer. However, I'm honored to say that wasn't my experience! Leeonnas was such a pleasure to work with and made the process as smooth and stress free as possible. He went above and beyond to ensure that I was aware of everything going on prior to closing and I couldn't think of a better representative. Even after closing, he assisted me with additional questions and clarification needed. And the beat part is that he always assisted with the personable demeanor that only he has! Thank you again Leeonnas! 😊

We met him through our realtor and she assured us that we were in good hands. He was attentive, straightforward, and had one of the best sense of humors in the world. We not only got to see professionalism at its finest, but we knew we could trust him and Cross Country Equity with our lending options. If we could do it all again, we would choose Cross Country Equity over and over.
Thank you Leeonas for making my family home owning dreams come true.

Leeonas Richardson got us to the closing table in under a week. He helped us pre-prepare and he worked early and late days to make it happen. The process was confidential, professional, seamless, detailed, easy and with very clear process. Follow his directions and all your home buying dreams will come true. 3rd time working with him and he has our business for the 4th. If your don't want to feel like a number at a bank call him. You get his direct number and he respond to text messages and emails promptly even on weekends. No question seemed to simple or troublesome to him.  My husband are moving in this weekend!

My husband and I are forever grateful to Leeonnas and his team! As we began this process, I prayed to God to send us help (Psalm 20:2)  and he honored this prayer by sending Leeonnas across our path (literally riding his bike down Pines Rd). I told my husband this was "a sign". Just shortly after seeing him, he called my husband and jokingly we told him we'd be talking to him soon.  That was the beginning of an awesome journey that brought us to our closing date orchestrated by God! Leeonnas is GREAT at what he does and he'll tell you "this is what I do!" He is truly a Godsend to us, walking us through this process step by step and answering ALL of my questions and concerns! We can't thank him enough for all he has done for our family. We are forever GRATEFUL!

Leeonnas is a life saver and I will always point people to him when they need a mortgage. This is my 2nd time using Cross Country Equity when shopping for a mortgage. Both times were drama free. You will do yourself a favor by reaching out.

I'm moving to Mars...

The Covid Pandemic has impacted everyone's life to varying degrees, and I was certainly no exception to the rule. It was but a moment's notice that I found out that I had to uproot my family from the comforts of our wonderful home and life we had built in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and move to Houston, Texas because my job was transferring me there.

My wife and I quickly began the house buying process and listed our home in Baton Rouge for sale. We were matched with a great lender in Texas, and was preapproved for a home we absolutely loved! Our home in Baton Rouge sold relatively quickly, and we signed our beloved home over to the new owners in mid-September. The only issue was our new home in Houston was a new construction build and would not be ready until the end of September. We weren't all too worried---I had been staying in Houston at a corporate hotel since August and my wife and daughter were to go stay with family for the 2 week or so gap between the big move. This is when the issues with our lender started to creep around.

With about two weeks left before we were scheduled to close and move into our Houston home---our lender had been promising to call or email us the final things we needed to get us across the finish line, but those communications never came. I was so busy with the new job that I did not have all day to play phone tag, so I assumed that everything was good since we did not hear anything. Well, a week before the close date the lender finally called and it was one of the most disappointing calls I ever received in my life. To boil it all down, the lender basically told me we needed to come up with an additional $15,000 for us to close. I was shocked, I did not understand what was happening. They said, "You have to money" (of course they have your banking information) or you can reach out to a family member and ask for a "gift"--they even sent me a gift letter template to use. Needless to say, I was depressed and felt as if I had let my family down. It was well past 8 pm on the day, and I called my wife to tell her the disappointing news--at that moment it seemed like our home had escaped us. We were staring at a loss of about $6,000 in earnest money and upgrades. We were also now faced with the emotional impact of now shifting our living style to an apartment--something my wife dreaded.

It was well past 9 pm now as I sat in my hotel feeling as if I failed my family. I'm a problem solver by nature, so instinctively, my brain began to race for a solution---and somehow/someway Mr. Leeonnas's name popped into my head. I had worked with Mr. Leeonna's and the fine folks at Cross Country Equity on the purchase of my very first home nearly a decade ago. I hate to be the person to call someone when you need them, but boy I sure did need him now so I had to put my pride aside for this one. I quickly searched the depths of my email box to find 8-year-old emails we had exchanged. I sent the email out, and less than 10 mins later Mr. Leeonna's was ringing my phone. We spoke as if we were best friends and had not missed a beat. I got him up-to-date on what was going on, and he assured me he would get me into my home. On that very night, Mr. Leeonna's went back into the office and had my preliminary documents for my home loan sent to me well past midnight! Long story short, Mr. Leeonna's stayed in constant contact and was able to get me and my family in our home in 10 days! He also saved us a ton of money because he got us a better interest rate, and lower downpayment than the previous deal I was getting with the other lender! After this experience, I told Mr. Leeonna's that I don't care if the next house I buy is on Mars--- I will be calling him and his team first to see what they can do for me, and you should too!

Due to these people not doing their job properly, we lost the sale on our house and the purchase on the house we had planned to buy. There were about 5 families that we know of, that were affected due to this man's poor performance. All of the families had contingencies on their contracts, and the day we were to all close, the deal fell through because Mr. Richardson did not do his job for his client. They told our agents a number of times their borrower was "clear to close" which was a lie. We had our entire house packed and ready to be put on the moving truck. We now have to start the buying/selling process all over. All because one lender did not do his research, lied and decided to drag his feet. I would never recommend these people to conduct any financial business for anyone.

There probably isn't enough room to share my thoughts regarding Mr. Gary Moore and Cross Country Equity. I was connected to him through my Realtor with a simple introduction "Call him, He will help you get pre-qualified." From the first time I met him until "closing" on our new home Mr. Moore went from "Lender" to "Family." Professional, Courteous,
Knowledgeable, Committed, and most of all Caring, are just a few words I can use to honestly describe Mr. Moore which I believe are also reflective of the Company and his work ethic. Our home buying experience was nothing short of a MIRACLE and the hard work, long hours, "crossing t's and dotting i's was certainly a very large part of it. We are eternally grateful that we met and were connected to Mr. Moore and Cross Country Equity for the purchase of our new home and recommend them to anyone who is looking for a quality home buying experience!

As a seller, make sure a prospective buyer is pre-approved before ever working with this mortgage company.  2 months absolutely lost, waiting for this company to figure out what it was doing.  Sale never made.  Oh, wait, this client was "pre-approved."  Pre-approved!!!!!  Horrible!!!!!  Not the way to do business, #knowyourjob.

Stopped by to have three or four sheets notarized. Her office was nice and waited as she was with another client for tax season. While that client was filling out paperwork, she attended to me. She was fast, informative, and pleasant. I usually pay around $25 per page from another lady that use to do this for me. Mrs. Dixon charged me far less, so much less I thought it was a mistake & asked if that price was right.. I asked twice. I would definitely return or recommend anybody who needs some notary work done to see her.

I called both numbers.  As the second call was ringing. I got a text from her saying "I cant talk, text me." I texted and waited. And then texted "Can you do it" and waited.  And after an hour, i texted that I'd move on....she obviously doesnt need the business.

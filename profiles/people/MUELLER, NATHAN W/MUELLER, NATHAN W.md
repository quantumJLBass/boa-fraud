Federal Prison Camp in Duluth, Minn
$8.5 million from ING
**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
Nathan holds a B.A. in Accounting from Gustavus Adolphus College and was a licensed CPA from 2002-2010. He has over 13 years of public accounting experience and 15 years of corporate accounting experience with a focus on financial reporting, cash processing, tax, and accounting controls.
**A corporate mistake opened the door for Nathan J. Mueller's fraud.** Two years after the error was made, he discovered he was authorized to request and approve checks of up to $250,000. A co-worker also was accidentally granted the same privileges, while a subordinate was authorized to request checks. 

**Mueller, his subordinate, and the co-worker often logged on as one another to get work done.** This allowed Mueller to request checks under one identity and then approve them under his own account.

**Mueller and his subordinate were allowed to physically pick up checks.** This allowed Mueller to take physical checks to the bank to be deposited into the account of a fake vendor he set up.

**Mueller hid his debits in ledger accounts that he controlled.** Better separation of duties could have helped to prevent the scheme.

**The fraud netted nearly $8.5 million in four years.** The money was used to buy expensive cars, watches, and nighttime entertainment as well as to pay for numerous trips from Minnesota to Las Vegas. Living beyond one's means is a classic red flag of possible fraud.

**Mueller told his wife his extra money was from gambling winnings.** After a while, she began to doubt that explanation, and they divorced.

  

**The fraud was uncovered when Mueller's ex-wife expressed her doubts about his income to his co-worker.** The co-worker spotted questionable transactions in the company records and brought them to management's attention. The scheme unraveled quickly after that.

**Mueller was sentenced to 97 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to fraud.** He is due to be released in September after 5½ years in prison.

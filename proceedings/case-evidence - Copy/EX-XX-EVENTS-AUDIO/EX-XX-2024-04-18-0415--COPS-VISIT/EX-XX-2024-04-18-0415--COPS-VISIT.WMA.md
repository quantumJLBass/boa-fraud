 There's open cases that are happening now with it because there's more than just the auction itself that was illegal because they had rigged it. That's what they did. And I have evidence of that because the lady that actually bought the house was the only one that was at the auction, which she had a printed check for exactly what the bank wanted. It's kind of hard to have an auction when you've got an exact amount. And it's within bounds that it has to be a public auction. And they didn't do that. They rigged it. She had admitted to me that she and four other developers were working with the bank ahead of the auction. She tried to get me to sell to her ahead of time and scare me to do that. But I got that on record. And the list kind of goes on and on and on from there. But the sale itself was fraudulent. It's not valid. The deed that they tried to put in is a fraud. and they're perpetuating it basically just moving through the paperwork because in that way it becomes more legit the more they move through. But there is an open case with Securities Exchange because the bank, there's a bigger fraud that was uncovered with the bank itself, which is how we got here. I hadn't paid a mortgage for four years, which is a really long time for anything. You have not paid mortgage for four years? I have not had to pay a mortgage for four years. I have a letter of full reconvenience, which is that big one. The one on the right side of the window? Yep. It says a letter of full reconvenience. If you know what reconvenience is, that means the title comes back to me, free and clear. Okay. So I have a letter of full reconvenience that says it's in my name, free and clear. Right there. And is that... That's legit. Was the home paid off? The home was paid off, as they said on the letter. So it says on the reconvenience right there that the debt was satisfied, that it's free and clear, and to come to me. Okay. And so that's the last legitimate legal document. When was that dated, do you remember? 2009. Okay. How long have you owned the home? For 16 years, something like that. And you had it completely paid off when it went up for auction? Well, that's the thing is it was, so it's got a letterary conveyance paid off. Then there was a fraudulent loan on it, which is kind of like, why would I redo the loan on it? And mind you, I have paperwork for all of this. This is the part that goes to the security exchange for everything. It's part of a much bigger fraud that's systemic across quite a few people. people. So there's probably at least a couple thousand people that are in the same boat as me. And Bank of America is the bank. They've already been committed, found guilty of the fraud for all this. Was that the title holder or the loan holder of the home when you were making the loan signing? Loan holder. I'm the owner. It's a deed. It's a trustee deed. So I'm the owner of the house. you take a mortgage out on it and the loan is what this is collateral for the loan so it's not like they owned it but what they're doing is they're committing fraud in all this and yeah that's collateral that's how it motivated yeah very I mean it was up and down it means for years so that different amount changes but that was the that's the point is that they had done their fraud and so when it came time to address it they played games and just did shenanigans until we ended up here but it's in their best interest to kind of push through but like I said I talked to the prosecutor's office already they said don't don't move or be relocated until you guys have put the case in front of them for fraud and then it would be addressed from there. Nathan Rudd, Nathaniel Rudd I think is his name? But you guys are more than welcome please do read read the papers there it's it spells it out very clearly on on everything because even right now they couldn't do anything because they haven't even served me with a proper eviction yet. So I have no eviction, nothing like that. So even let's say I was completely wrong and everything like that, I still have yet to have a notice of eviction. You couldn't remove me for any reason right now. And even at that, there's no writ for this either. So that's where we're kind of sitting. So it sounds like they haven't served an eviction paperwork. Okay. Well, we'll chat with the person that called us here. Sounds like the person who bought the place actually lives in Utah. So I don't have a way to contact him. I'm kind of third-party contact with him right now. Yeah, that's the lawyer in Utah. They actually root out, it looks like they root out to Winchester. Apparently this was Fort Thug and now an LLC owns it or something like that. Yeah, an LLC bought it is what it is, but it's a shell company is what it is. They root in Salt Lake, but they actually, there's another proxy that is in Winchester. Like an office? What they're doing is they're playing a shell game with this. From what I've researched right now, it's a co-op of people, which I haven't figured out who that is yet. But they have a shell company, two shell companies actually, because it's not just one, but two in Utah. And then they're registered over there. And the guy you probably are talking to is the lawyer for them in Salt Lake. Because if it's in Salt Lake that you've already talked to, that's the lawyer. Okay, alright. Can you tell it for me? Yep. And you are, what's your name? Jeremy. Jeremy, okay. How long you lived here? It's been a while, right? Yeah, for like more than 15 years. Something like that. Like I said, please, do read those. I mean, that right there, the letter of full reconvenience, that's legal. That's down at the county recorder's office. You can read there. What they're trying to do is they're just trying to paperwork me out of my place and cover up their fraud. the auction itself was illegal and I have the evidence of that the lady that called me is the same one that came down and wrote the check well she didn't write a check she came with printed check that's not much of an auction there if you come down with a printed check by yourself and you're the only one there it's it has to be a legit auction because you're supposed to get fair market values the starting bid and just and whatever sells like whatever the bank says I owe is what they get and then the remainder comes to me and they just put it through what they said that they owed, which is an amount that they keep just fiddling with the numbers there. But it's all, like I said, I had the Securities Exchange, the IRS, the Office of Inspector General for the IRS, for the Comptroller of the Currency, the Security Exchange, I think I already said that, Office of the Comptroller, or HUD, sorry, HUD, all have open cases that they're moving through, but they're slow to react and they just kind of move very slowly on this. Do you have an attorney you're dealing with? That's the problem is that I can't find an attorney. What Bank of America has done is they go around and because you need a contract for a mortgage, right? So they go to a contract or a real estate lawyer in the area and they play round robin. So when I go for help for a lawyer, like if I go to a family practice, they say, sorry, we don't practice in that area. But all the contracting and real estate lawyers are conflict of interest. I contacted over 90 different firms in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, and they're all telling me conflict of interest. They even had Idaho State Legal Aid tell me I have a conflict of interest. So I've had to do this on my own and keep them at bay, but I mean, like they tried to held the auction a year and a half ago, and I've been able to keep them at bay on my own there, but it's just one fraud after another that they keep committing, and they're just trying to avalanche it so that it becomes overwhelming for me. Has anybody tried to serve you eviction paperwork? Has any county deputies or anybody came out to try to serve anybody here paperwork? No. Okay. Is there anybody in the house with you? There's a tenant that has 90 days, so he can't be removed. He has 90 days? Yeah, because Idaho Housing will already said flat out that he has 90 days after the service of proper eviction. Okay. So he has, once he becomes evicted formally, then he has 90 days of property? He has 90 days, yeah. Do you have any standards like that or is yours just a regular eviction process? So the law reads that I have to rip because this is non-judicial. So they have to sue me for it and have a TRO put in. And so I get a notice of hearing, which I haven't received that either. And at that point, because like I said, I couldn't get a lawyer. And so the first time I tried to go through this when they tried to do the auction, I kind of failed because I didn't serve them correctly because they were playing this little game of we don't worry at this office, but we're not at this office. So I served them at the wrong office. But I'm letting them get the notice of hearing. So that way I can go ahead and then counter sue without having to go through that step of service. So I don't screw that up again. But, yeah, I haven't received a notice of hearing for TRO to have me taken, to be removed from the property. But that's, you know, that's what the law says, is that I'm supposed to, there's supposed to be a notice, and I haven't received that. And none of this has been proper. Okay. There's kind of... But it sounds like most of it's going to be civil at this point. Yep. I mean, even the auction stuff, those are civil charges, not criminal charges. Well, there is criminal charges in there because it breaks the Sherman Act, which is a felony. There are two felonies that get broken right there because they're price fixing it. Because, like I said, they sold it for the amount that the bank said I owed. But you're supposed to start an auction at the fair market value. And if one person comes with a printed check, that's definitely not an auction. And mind you, that's the lady that called me ahead of it saying that she was working with the bank. so that's fixing the auction it's supposed to be a public auction i get shorted by a hundred thousand dollars there just because whatever remainder after you know what the bank's paid off comes to me by law so they're they're just you know trying to cut me out there and and basically like a screw you because i've been throwing their side because i haven't i haven't folded uh like they wanted me to but that that's a that's felony i mean it's 10 years prison sentence a hundred uh million dollar fine for it and that's the case that that the prosecutor's office needs to have across their desk and that's what prosecutors office said told me don't you know that I wouldn't I shouldn't leave until you guys have put that case across her desk and that's really what I got Okay. Okay. As far as what I've said, because, see, here's the thing is, so Carrington Mortgage, the one that was the mortgage handler, they tried to get me to commit fraud with them. They tried to bribe me to sign backdated contract, a new deed, that would have voided that full letter of reconveyance. And so they tried to get me to be a party of their fraud. They tried to bribe me for it. So, and that's what I'm saying is they, I'm a witness to them committing fraud as well because they tried to get me to do it with them. So, and these aren't, these aren't civil frauds. These are criminal frauds. These are criminal cases. And by statute, I mean, I've looked them all up. Like I said, it breaks the Sherman Act, breaks several Idaho codes. I can email again you guys and give you the whole packet. I've emailed your captain. And I didn't, like I said, I didn't get a read receipt or a delivery receipt from it. So I don't know if he actually got it. But yeah, everyone keeps playing this game of it sounds civil, but it's not. That's the thing is I've done the work to make sure that it is not civil, that I'm not just, you know, screwed and I need to find a lawyer. Which is, like I said, I couldn't find a lawyer because it's all conflict of interest. I need authorities help and right now I'm getting you know the the three letter agencies engaged but they're going so slow and right now you guys don't know you know like I mean you're following your what you need to do but you guys think it's civil and and in that process while that happens then I I what am supposed to comply with a fraud when they're committing fraud and and I'm supposed to just be like, okay, I'm just going to go with this. It seems a little weird to do. I can email you guys all the stuff that shows what's what and show you where it says in the statutes that are criminal stuff. It's not just civil. I do recognize that some of it is civil. A third of it is civil. But there are 28 different violations of statute and code, and of that like two-thirds of it is criminal. Yes, as far as that goes, it's obviously trying to listen to you explain it when we don't have the background. Obviously, it sounds like you're pretty familiar with it, but we're not. So there needs to be like I think you're talking about a packet would be helpful and that's something we have to take and review and look at and honestly probably go up to our detectives and they'd have to look through it as well and that's not going to be a fast process either. That's what I'm asking for, is actually look into it because it's legit. I had the money. I didn't just stop paying my mortgage or something. It was never like that. I mean, this is fraud all from top to bottom. Yeah, and as far as you said, there's Idaho codes. That's stuff we can look into. If there's federal acts and stuff, that's going to be outside of what we can handle, which I'm sure you already know because you're dealing with the federal agencies on that. But, yeah, if you have a packet, like a big packet, if you can print that out, I'll bring that into the police department and we'll do the initial report on it and then probably pass it on to detectives from there. I'd be happy to. You say you emailed it? I emailed it, yeah. The problem is with our email, sometimes it will not accept large files. If you're trying to do a packet, it may not go through because our emails won't accept that huge of a packet. Yeah, and I didn't get a bounce back response. I mean IT. I so so normally I Set it up so that I would get responses, but I got nothing back so I have no idea if that was the case But I'm happy to bring it down and I could bring it on flash drive if you want There's there's a lot of evidence. So there's like 500 some odd pages of evidence. I mean paperwork. That's kind of the way it goes But there's also recorded conversations and video or not video of screenshots of like the intimidation and coercion to sell ahead. So I have all that evidence. And I've been very diligent about recording it, making sure it's tagged and logged and everything. But I can bring it down on a thumb drive because some of that can't. Obviously, the... Yeah, I think probably if you just have everything, having 500 pages probably wouldn't be very fine initially. So if it's all on the thumb drive with all those different media, whether it's the Word docs or the screenshots, then we can probably, obviously we can put that into evidence. It'd be easier than doing 500 pages plus printed pictures or whatever. Perfect. I will do that ASAP. All right. Sounds good. Yep. Sorry that you guys had to come out and waste your time, but I'm glad that you guys are listening. I appreciate it. This has been hard, so. I don't doubt that. Sounds like it. Have a good rest of your day. Thank you guys. Have a good day. Alright, that was the Houston Police Department. Today is April 18th, it's 3.07 Pacific Standard Time PM. 3.07 PM. Yeah, thank you. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm just nervous. it will actually be... Alright. Jeremy Bass, 317-82. Didn't get the officers' names. So, we'll see how this goes. They said to come in, drop off a thumb drive, and we'll go from there. Recap. I told them everything to... They explained everything they basically hear to see what's going on, I guess. and that we're going to have a formal eviction notice and everything, because they tried to do it before, as I explained, and it was improper. And, yeah. So hopefully everything came and was heard on this. But, yeah. Jeremy Bass 317-82.

00:00:01 Jeremy L Bass

There's open cases that are are happening now with it because there's more than just the auction itself. That was illegal because they had rigged it is what they did. They and I have evidence of that because they, the lady that actually.

00:00:18 Jeremy L Bass

Bought the house.

00:00:20 Jeremy L Bass

Was the only.

00:00:20 Jeremy L Bass

That was at the at the.

00:00:25 Jeremy L Bass

Auction.

00:00:26 Jeremy L Bass

Which she had a printed check for exactly what the bank wanted.

00:00:30 Jeremy L Bass

It's kind of hard to have an auction when you're, you know, you got an exact amount.

00:00:35 Jeremy L Bass

And it's within bounds. It's it's that it has to be a public option and they didn't do.

00:00:45 Jeremy L Bass

She had admitted to me.

00:00:49 Jeremy L Bass

That that she and four other developers were working with the bank ahead of the auction, she tried to get me to sell to her ahead of time.

00:00:58 Jeremy L Bass

And scare me to do that but.

00:01:03 Jeremy L Bass

She I got that on record.

00:01:07 Jeremy L Bass

And.

00:01:09 Jeremy L Bass

The list kind of goes on and.

00:01:10 Jeremy L Bass

And.

00:01:10 Jeremy L Bass

From there, but.

00:01:14 Jeremy L Bass

The sale itself was fraudulent.

00:01:16 Jeremy L Bass

It's not valid.

00:01:19 Jeremy L Bass

The deed that they tried to put in is up.

00:01:23 Jeremy L Bass

Broad and.

00:01:26 Jeremy L Bass

Their perpetuating it basically just moving through the paperwork because in that way it becomes more legit the more they move through.

00:01:36 Jeremy L Bass

But there is an open case with with Securities Exchange because the bank.

00:01:42 Jeremy L Bass

There's a bigger fraud that was uncovered with the bank itself, which is how we got here.

00:01:47 Jeremy L Bass

I've had paid mortgage for four years, which is a really long time.

00:01:54 Jeremy L Bass

For anything.

00:01:55 OFFICER 1 - Female

You have not paid mortgage before you.

00:01:57 Jeremy L Bass

Have not had to pay mortgage for four years.

00:01:59 Jeremy L Bass

I have a letter forward conveyance which is that big one.

00:02:03 OFFICER 1 - Female

The one on the right side of the window.

00:02:04 Jeremy L Bass

Yep, says the.

00:02:05 Jeremy L Bass

Fully conveyance if you know what it recommends, is that means the title comes back to me.

00:02:10 Jeremy L Bass

And clear.

00:02:12 Jeremy L Bass

OK, so I have a letter of four reconvene that says it's in my name, free and clear.

00:02:17 Jeremy L Bass

Right there.

00:02:18 OFFICER 1 - Female

Is that?

00:02:20 Jeremy L Bass

That's legit in.

00:02:21 OFFICER 1 - Female

Her step home paid off.

00:02:23 Jeremy L Bass

The home was paid off.

00:02:26 Jeremy L Bass

As as they said in there. So it says on the reconciliance right there that it's it was the debt was satisfied that it's free and clear and to come to me and so that's the last legitimate.

00:02:41 Jeremy L Bass

Legal document and.

00:02:44 OFFICER 1 - Female

That data.

00:02:45 Jeremy L Bass

2009.

00:02:48 OFFICER 1 - Female

How long have you owned the home?

00:02:50 Jeremy L Bass

For.

00:02:52 Jeremy L Bass

16 years, something like that.

00:02:56 OFFICER 1 - Female

And you had it completely paid off when it went up for option.

00:02:59 Jeremy L Bass

That's. Well, that's The thing is, is it was.

00:03:03 Jeremy L Bass

It's so it's got a letter, E conveyance paid off.

00:03:07 Jeremy L Bass

Then there was a fraudulent loan on it.

00:03:10 Jeremy L Bass

So which is kind of like why would I redo the loan on it?

00:03:17 Jeremy L Bass

And mind you, I have paperwork for all of.

00:03:20 Jeremy L Bass

This is this is the part that goes to the security exchange for for everything. It's part of a much bigger fraud that's systemic across quite few people.

00:03:34 Jeremy L Bass

So like there's like probably at least a couple 1000 people that are in same boat as me and.

00:03:41 Jeremy L Bass

Bank of America is the.

00:03:43 Jeremy L Bass

They've already been committed, found guilty of the fraud for all this so.

00:03:49 OFFICER 1 - Female

Look at the title holder or the loan holder of the home when you were making.

00:03:53 Jeremy L Bass

Loan holder I I have.

00:03:53

5.

00:03:54 Jeremy L Bass

I'm the owner.

00:03:56 Jeremy L Bass

That's it's a deed.

00:03:58 Jeremy L Bass

Trustee deed.

00:03:59 Jeremy L Bass

So I'm the owner of the house. Then you take a mortgage out on it and the loan is what this is. Collateral for the loan. So it's not like they owned it, but what they're doing is they're committing fraud and all this and.

00:04:12 OFFICER 1 - Female

Lateral discussion of them came in being made on that collateral.

00:04:13 Jeremy L Bass

Yeah, that's.

00:04:14 Jeremy L Bass

That's how I murdered first.

00:04:18 Jeremy L Bass

Huh.

00:04:18 OFFICER 1 - Female

Were there payments that were supposed to be made?

00:04:21 OFFICER 1 - Female

Were the payments being made?

00:04:23 OFFICER 1 - Female

Yeah.

00:04:24 OFFICER 1 - Female

How much for the payments?

00:04:26 Jeremy L Bass

Very. I mean, it was up and.

00:04:28 Jeremy L Bass

It means for years so that different amount changes, but that was the that's the point is that.

00:04:35 Jeremy L Bass

Uh, they had done their fraud and so when it came time to address it, they played games and.

00:04:46 Jeremy L Bass

Did shenanigans until we ended up here, but it's in their best interest to kind of push through.

00:04:53 Jeremy L Bass

But like I said, I talked to the prosecutor's office already.

00:04:56 Jeremy L Bass

They said don't don't move or be relocated until you guys have put the case in front of them.

00:05:05 Jeremy L Bass

For fraud.

00:05:08 Jeremy L Bass

And then it being addressed from there.

00:05:11 Jeremy L Bass

Nathan ro.

00:05:12 Jeremy L Bass

3rd Nathaniel Rudd or anything is his name.

00:05:16 OFFICER 1 - Female

Bye.

00:05:18 Jeremy L Bass

But you guys are more than welcome. Please do read.

00:05:21 Jeremy L Bass

Read the.

00:05:22 Jeremy L Bass

There it is spelled out very clearly on on everything 'cause even right now, they couldn't do anything because they haven't even served me with a proper eviction yet.

00:05:34 Jeremy L Bass

So I have no eviction, nothing like that. So you will say I was completely wrong and and everything like that, I still have yet to have a notice of eviction. They couldn't.

00:05:44 Jeremy L Bass

Couldn't remove me for any reason right now.

00:05:48 Jeremy L Bass

And even at that, there's no RIP for this either. So.

00:05:53 Jeremy L Bass

That's where we're kind of sitting.

00:05:56 OFFICER 2 - MALE (OFFICER 3 tells OFFICER 2 what was just found out)

I said it sounds like the paperwork, so.

00:06:03 OFFICER 1 - Female

Well, we'll chat with the person that called us.

00:06:11 OFFICER 1 - Female

Sounds like the person who bought the place actually lives in Utah, so I don't have a way to contact him.

00:06:17 OFFICER 1 - Female

Kind of third party contact with him right now so.

00:06:20 Jeremy L Bass

Yeah, that's the lawyer from in Utah.

00:06:23 Jeremy L Bass

They actually root out.

00:06:24 Jeremy L Bass

It looks like they root out to Winchester.

00:06:27 OFFICER 2 - MALE

Apparently this was foreclosed and now an LLC owns it.

00:06:28 Jeremy L Bass

So.

00:06:30 OFFICER 2 - MALE

Something like that.

00:06:30 Jeremy L Bass

Yeah, an LLC bought it is what it is, but it's a shell company, is what it is. They root in, in, in Salt Lake, but they actually there's another proxy that is in Winchester.

00:06:43 OFFICER 1 - Female

Go off.

00:06:44 Jeremy L Bass

Playing a show game with this.

00:06:46 Jeremy L Bass

So from what I've researched right now, it's a coop of people which I haven't figured out who that is yet, but they have a shell company Q shell companies.

00:06:59 Jeremy L Bass

It's not just one, but 2IN.

00:07:01 Jeremy L Bass

Utah and then they're registered over there and the guy you probably are talking to is the lawyer for them in Salt Lake.

00:07:10 Jeremy L Bass

If it's in Salt Lake that you've already talked to, that's the lawyer.

00:07:14 OFFICER 1 - Female

All right.

00:07:15 OFFICER 1 - Female

Thank you for me.

00:07:15 Jeremy L Bass

Yep.

00:07:19 OFFICER 3 - MALE

Work on these guys.

00:07:37 OFFICER 3 - MALE

I.

00:07:42 OFFICER 3 - MALE

And you are. What's your name?

00:07:43 OFFICER 2 - MALE

Jeremy, OK, how many lives here?

00:07:46 OFFICER 2 - MALE

A while, right?

00:07:47 Jeremy L Bass

Yeah, for like.

00:07:49 Speaker 4

More than 15 years.

00:07:52 Jeremy L Bass

Something like that.

00:07:55 Jeremy L Bass

Like I said, please do read.

00:07:57 Jeremy L Bass

I mean that that right there the letter for reconvened that's legal.

00:08:03 Jeremy L Bass

Down at the county recorders.

00:08:05 Jeremy L Bass

You can read there what they're going to do is they're trying to paperwork me out of my place.

00:08:12 Jeremy L Bass

And cover up their fraud.

00:08:14 Jeremy L Bass

I the auction itself was illegal and I have the evidence of that. The lady that called me is the same one that came down and wrote the check while she didn't write a check, she came with printed check.

00:08:26 Jeremy L Bass

Not much of an auction.

00:08:27 Jeremy L Bass

There you come down with the printed check by yourself and they're the only one there.

00:08:31 Jeremy L Bass

Umm, it has to be a legit auction because you're supposed to get fair market value as starting bid and and whatever sells like whatever the bank says I owe is what they get.

00:08:45 Jeremy L Bass

Then the remainder comes to me.

00:08:47 Jeremy L Bass

And they just put it for what? They said that they owe, which is an amount that they keep just fiddling with the numbers.

00:08:56 OFFICER 1 - Female

There.

00:08:57 Jeremy L Bass

But it's all.

00:09:00 Jeremy L Bass

Well, like I said that I have security exchange, the IRS, the office of Inspector General for the IRS, for the controller or comp controller of the currency.

00:09:12 Jeremy L Bass

The security exchange or I think I already said that.

00:09:18 Jeremy L Bass

Office.

00:09:21 Jeremy L Bass

The comp controller Hut. Sorry HUD all have open cases that they're moving through.

00:09:28 Jeremy L Bass

But they're slow to react and and they just kind of move very slowly on this and.

00:09:35 Jeremy L Bass

Yeah. So it's kind of a.

00:09:37 Jeremy L Bass

That's problem is that I can't find an attorney that what Bank of America has done is they, so they they go around and because you need a contract for mortgage, right.

00:09:47 Jeremy L Bass

So they go to a contract or a real estate lawyer in the area and they play round Robin. So when I go.

00:09:54 Jeremy L Bass

For help for a lawyer, like if I go to a family practice, they say sorry we don't practice in.

00:10:00 Jeremy L Bass

Area but all the contract and real estate lawyers are conflict of interest.

00:10:06 Jeremy L Bass

I contacted over 90 different firms in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, and they're all telling me conflict of interest.

00:10:13 Jeremy L Bass

Even had Idaho State legal aid.

00:10:15 Jeremy L Bass

Tell me I have a conflict of interest.

00:10:18 Jeremy L Bass

So I've had to do this on my own and and keep them at Bay, but I mean like they tried to help the auction year and a half ago and I've been able to keep them at Bay on my own there.

00:10:31 Jeremy L Bass

But it it's just one fraud after another that.

00:10:33 Jeremy L Bass

Keep committing.

00:10:35 Jeremy L Bass

They just trying.

00:10:36 Jeremy L Bass

To avalanche it so that it becomes overwhelming for me.

00:10:41 OFFICER 1 - Female

To serve you eviction paperwork has any county deputies or anybody came out to try to serve anybody here? Paperwork.

00:10:47 Speaker 4

No.

00:10:48 OFFICER 1 - Female

Is there anybody in the House with you?

00:10:51 Jeremy L Bass

There's a tenant that has 90 days, so he can't be removed.

00:10:55 OFFICER 1 - Female

He has 90 days.

00:10:56 Jeremy L Bass

Yeah, because Idaho housing will.

00:11:00 Jeremy L Bass

Already said flat out that he.

00:11:02 Jeremy L Bass

He has 90 days after the service of a proper eviction.

00:11:07 OFFICER 1 - Female

So he has once he becomes evicted formally, then he has 90 days.

00:11:12 Jeremy L Bass

He has 90 days, yeah.

00:11:14 OFFICER 1 - Female

What kind of do you have? Any standards like that? Or is there just?

00:11:16 OFFICER 1 - Female

Regular eviction process.

00:11:19 Jeremy L Bass

So the law reads that I'm I have to RIP because this is non judicial so they have to sue me for it and have atro put in.

00:11:27 Jeremy L Bass

And so I get a notice of hearing which I haven't received that either. And at that point I'm because, like I said, I couldn't.

00:11:34 Jeremy L Bass

Lawyer. And so the first time I tried to go through this, when they tried to do the auction, I kind of failed because I didn't serve them correctly. 'cause they were playing this little game of we don't worry this office, but we're not at this office, so I.

00:11:48 Jeremy L Bass

Him at the wrong office.

00:11:50 Jeremy L Bass

But.

00:11:52 Jeremy L Bass

I'm letting them get the the notice of hearing so that way I can go ahead and then countersue without having to go through that stuff of service. So I don't screw that up.

00:12:01 Jeremy L Bass

Again. But yeah, I haven't received a notice of hearing for TR 02. Have me taken to be removed from the property.

00:12:11 Jeremy L Bass

But that's, you know, that's what the law says is that I'm supposed to.

00:12:16 Jeremy L Bass

There's supposed to be a a notice and I haven't received that, and none of none of none of this has been proper. There's kind of.

00:12:23 OFFICER 1 - Female

It sounds like.

00:12:24 OFFICER 1 - Female

Most of it's going to be civil at this point. I mean, even the auction stuff, those are civil charges, not criminal charges.

00:12:24

It.

00:12:25 Jeremy L Bass

Yep.

00:12:29 Jeremy L Bass

Well, there's criminal charges in there because it breaks the Sherman Act, which is a felony.

00:12:34 Jeremy L Bass

There are two felonies that get broken right there, and because their their price, their price fixing it because like I said, they sold it. They sold it for the amount that the banks that I owed.

00:12:45 Jeremy L Bass

But you're supposed to start auction at the fair market value, and if one person.

00:12:50 Jeremy L Bass

We.

00:12:51 Jeremy L Bass

Check. That's definitely not an option.

00:12:53 Jeremy L Bass

And and mind you, that's the lady that called me ahead of it, saying that she was working with the bank.

00:12:58 Jeremy L Bass

So that's fixing the.

00:13:00 Jeremy L Bass

It's supposed to be a public auction.

00:13:01 Jeremy L Bass

I get shorted by \$100,000 there just 'cause whatever remainder after.

00:13:06 Jeremy L Bass

You know.

00:13:06 Jeremy L Bass

The bank's paid off comes to me by law, so.

00:13:10 Jeremy L Bass

They're they're just, you know, trying to cut me out there and and basically like a screw you because I've been in thorn their side because I haven't.

00:13:18 Jeremy L Bass

I haven't folded like they wanted me to, but.

00:13:22 Jeremy L Bass

That that's a that's.

00:13:24 Jeremy L Bass

I mean, it's 10 years prison sentence, a hundred \$1,000,000 fine for it. And that's the case that that the prosecutors office needs to have across their desk and that's what prosecutors office said.

00:13:38 Jeremy L Bass

Told me. Don't you know that I?

00:13:40 Jeremy L Bass

I shouldn't leave until you guys have put that case across her desk, and that's really what I got.

00:13:47 OFFICER 1 - Female

They're gonna go.

00:13:49 OFFICER 1 - Female

And so there's gonna be expecting them and then you can get them all rolling on your side for whatever else you have to do.

00:13:51

I.

00:13:54 OFFICER 1 - Female

So as.

00:13:55 OFFICER 1 - Female

Of right.

00:13:55 OFFICER 1 - Female

Now we don't need anything.

00:13:57

For you.

00:13:57 Jeremy L Bass

OK, as far as what I've.

00:13:58 OFFICER 1 - Female

OK.

00:14:01 Jeremy L Bass

Because, see, here's The thing is, is so parenting mortgage, the one that was the mortgage handler, they tried to get me to commit fraud with them.

00:14:08 Jeremy L Bass

They tried to bribe me to sign back dated contract.

00:14:12 Jeremy L Bass

A new deed that would have avoided the the avoided that.

00:14:15

None.

00:14:19 Jeremy L Bass

Full liabilityance and so they tried to get me to be party of their fraud.

00:14:24 Jeremy L Bass

Tried to bribe me for it so.

00:14:28 Jeremy L Bass

And that's.

00:14:30 Jeremy L Bass

They I'm a witness to them committing fraud as well because they tried to get me to do it with them.

00:14:36 Jeremy L Bass

So, and these aren't these aren't civil frauds.

00:14:39 Jeremy L Bass

Are criminal frauds.

00:14:41 Jeremy L Bass

These are criminal cases and and by statute, I mean I've looked them all up. Like I said, it breaks the Sherman act.

00:14:47 Jeremy L Bass

Breaks several Idaho codes.

00:14:49 Jeremy L Bass

I can e-mail again you guys and give you the whole packet.

00:14:54 Jeremy L Bass

I've emailed your captain.

00:14:56 Jeremy L Bass

I didn't like. I said I didn't get a read receipt or delivery receipt from it, so I don't know if he actually got it.

00:15:01 Jeremy L Bass

But yeah, everyone keeps playing this game of it's it sounds civil, but it's.

00:15:08 Jeremy L Bass

That's The thing is, it's it's I've done the work to make sure that it is not civil, that I'm not just, you know, screwed. And I need to do, you know, find a lawyer, which is, like I said, I couldn't find a lawyer because it's all conflict of.

00:15:21 Jeremy L Bass

I need authority's help, and right now I'm getting, you know, the the three letter agencies engaged.

00:15:31 Jeremy L Bass

Going so slow and right now you guys don't know. You know, like, I mean, you're following your what you need to do but.

00:15:40 Jeremy L Bass

You guys think it's civil and and in that process while that happens then I I what am supposed to comply with a fraud when they're committing fraud and I'm supposed to just be like, OK, I'm just.

00:15:51 Jeremy L Bass

To go with this.

00:15:52 Jeremy L Bass

It seems a little weird to to to do.

00:15:57

A.

00:15:57 Jeremy L Bass

But I can e-mail you guys all the stuff that shows you know what's what and and show you where the where it says in the statutes that are criminal stuff.

00:16:07 Jeremy L Bass

Not just civil.

00:16:09 Jeremy L Bass

I know I do recognize that some of it is civil, like 1/3 of it is civil.

00:16:13 Jeremy L Bass

But there are 28 different violations of statute and code, and of that like 2/3 of it is criminal.

00:16:27 OFFICER 2 - MALE

Yes, as far as that goes, obviously.

00:16:29 OFFICER 2 - MALE

Trying to listen to you explain it when we don't have the.

00:16:32 OFFICER 2 - MALE

Obviously, you sound like you're pretty familiar with it, but we're not, so there needs to be like, I think, like you talked about a packet would be helpful and that's something we have to take and review and look at and honestly probably go up to our detectives and.

00:16:39 Speaker 4

Yeah.

00:16:41

I.

00:16:43 OFFICER 2 - MALE

Have to look through it as well and that's not gonna be a fast process either.

00:16:46 Jeremy L Bass

That's that's what I that's what I'm asking for is actually look into it because it's legit.

00:16:47

But.

00:16:51 Jeremy L Bass

Not I.

00:16:53

I didn't.

00:16:53 Jeremy L Bass

I had the.

00:16:54 Jeremy L Bass

I didn't stop paying my mortgage.

00:16:56 Jeremy L Bass

Or something. It was never like that. I mean it.

00:17:00 Jeremy L Bass

Is fraud all from top to bottom?

00:17:02 OFFICER 2 - MALE

Yeah, as far as you said, there's Idaho.

00:17:03 OFFICER 2 - MALE

That stuff we can look into if there's act like federal acts and stuff that's gonna be.

00:17:07 OFFICER 2 - MALE

Of what we can handle.

00:17:08 OFFICER 2 - MALE

Yep, which I'm sure you already know because you're dealing with the federal agencies on.

00:17:11 Speaker 4

Yep.

00:17:11 OFFICER 2 - MALE

But yeah, if you have like a packet, like a big packet, if you can print that out, bring that into the Police Department.

00:17:17 OFFICER 2 - MALE

And we'll we'll do the initial report on it and then probably like pass on.

00:17:20 OFFICER 2 - MALE

Checks from there and be happy to.

00:17:21 Jeremy L Bass

I I I emailed it.

00:17:22 OFFICER 3 - MALE

They say you emailed.

00:17:24 OFFICER 3 - MALE

Yeah, with our e-mail, sometimes we cannot. It will not accept.

00:17:25

The problem is.

00:17:29 OFFICER 3 - MALE

Large files. If you're trying to do a packet, it may not go through because we can't accept our emails, won't accept that huge of a packet.

00:17:30 Jeremy L Bass

OK, that made.

00:17:37 Jeremy L Bass

Yeah. And I didn't get a bounce back response.

00:17:39 Jeremy L Bass

I mean it.

00:17:41 Jeremy L Bass

So normally I set it up so that I get responses, but I got nothing back, so I have no idea if that was the case, but I'm happy to bring it down.

00:17:50 Jeremy L Bass

On Flash drive, if you want, there's there's a lot of evidence.

00:17:53 Jeremy L Bass

There's like 500 some odd pages of evidence.

00:17:58 Jeremy L Bass

That's kind of the way it goes, but there's also recorded conversations and video or not video.

00:18:08 Jeremy L Bass

Uh screenshots of like like the intimidation and coercion to sell ahead.

00:18:15 Jeremy L Bass

So I have all that evidence and I've been very diligent about recording it, making sure it's tagged and logged and and everything.

00:18:23 Speaker 4

That I can.

00:18:23 Jeremy L Bass

Bring it down on a thumb drive because some of that can't. Obviously the.

00:18:26 OFFICER 2 - MALE

Yeah, I think probably if you just have everything we having 500 pages probably be.

00:18:30 OFFICER 2 - MALE

Thumb drive with all those different media, whether it's the word docs or the screenshots, then we can probably obviously put that into evidence.

00:18:37

Yeah.

00:18:42 OFFICER 2 - MALE

Printing pictures or whatever so.

00:18:44 Jeremy L Bass

Perfect. I will do that ASAP.

00:18:48 OFFICER 3 - MALE

However, I can tell you that in legal documents, an exhibit is a section or attachment that provides additional information, evidence, or documentation to support a claim or statement within the legal proceeding. \n\nExhibit AD would be a labeled piece of evidence that was included as part of the amended complaint you referenced. Wet ink copy usually refers to a physical document that contains original signatures or marks as opposed to electronic copies or facsimiles.\n\nFor more specific information about EXHIBIT AD or its contents, you would need to access the actual exhibit document as mentioned in your proceedings. If you have that exhibit or additional context from the document, feel free to share that, and I may be able to help explain or provide more information about it.",

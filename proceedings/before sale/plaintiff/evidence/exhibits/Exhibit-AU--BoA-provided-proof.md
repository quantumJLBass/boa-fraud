**Jeremy Bass**,

I've carefully reviewed your correspondence and want to let you know our response.

Bank of America's records show that a mortgage was originated on **October 16, 2008**. I have enclosed the Note and Deed of Trust for your reference.

On **June 22, 2017**, Bank of America sent you the enclosed notice advising that the servicing of your loan would be transferred to **Carrington Mortgage Services LLC** effective **July 11, 2017**. At the time of the transfer, our records show that the loan was paid through the May 2017 installment and was delinquent. Although the loan was past due, Bank of America had not referred your loan to foreclosure. Please understand that in the mortgage lending industry, the transfer or sale of loan servicing to other servicing institutions is a common practice. I have also enclosed a copy of the loan history statement for your reference.

Please know that once the servicing is transferred, Bank of America no longer has any connection with the servicing of the loan after the effective date listed above. This would include but not limited to payments, foreclosure, and the referenced forbearance pandemic assistance. Bank of America would respectfully direct you to your current servicer for questions regarding the current servicing and foreclosure proceedings. Carrington Mortgage Services LLC can be reached at telephone number **800.561.4567**, Monday through Friday, **8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern** or in writing at:

**Carrington Mortgage Services LLC**

**EXHIBIT AU**

**NOTE**
**Case #: 121-Z492954-7**
**SEPTEMBER 4, 2008**
**Property Address:** 1515 21ST AVENUE, LEWISTON, ID 83501

1. **Parties:** "Borrower" means each person signing at the end of this Note, and the person's successors and assigns. "Lender" means ZIONS FIRST NATIONAL BANK, N.A., and its successors and assigns.

2. **BORROWER'S PROMISE TO PAY; INTEREST:** In return for a loan received from Lender, Borrower promises to pay the principal sum of **ONE HUNDRED FORTY-SIX THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTEEN DOLLARS (U.S. $146,418.00)**, plus interest, to the order of Lender. Interest will be charged on unpaid principal from the date of disbursement of the loan proceeds by Lender, at the rate of **SIX AND THREE-EIGHTHS PERCENT (6.375%)** per year until the full amount of principal has been paid.

3. **PROMISE TO PAY SECURED:** Borrower's promise to pay is secured by a mortgage, deed of trust, or similar security instrument that is dated the same date as this Note and called the "Security Instrument." That Security Instrument protects the Lender from losses which might result if Borrower defaults under this Note.

4. **MANNER OF PAYMENT:** (A) **Time:** Borrower shall make a payment of principal and interest to Lender on the first day of each month beginning on **NOVEMBER 1, 2008**. Any principal and interest remaining on the first day of **OCTOBER, 2038**, will be due on that date, which is called the "Maturity Date." (B) **Place:** Payment shall be made at **255 N. ADMIRAL BYRD RD, SALT LAKE CITY, UT 84116 or such places Lender may designate in writing by notice to Borrower.

**(D) Amount:** Each monthly payment of principal and interest will be in the amount of U.S. $913.46. This amount will be part of a larger monthly payment required by the Security Instrument, that shall be applied to principal, interest, and other items in the order described in the Security Instrument.

**(E) Allonge to this Note for payment adjustments:** If an allonge providing for payment adjustments is executed by Borrower together with this Note, the covenants of the allonge shall be incorporated into and shall amend and supplement the covenants of this Note as if the allonge were a part of this Note. \[Check applicable box\]

- [ ] Graduated Payment Allonge
- [ ] Growing Equity Allonge
- [ ] Other \[Specify\]

**5\. BORROWER'S RIGHT TO PREPAY:** Borrower has the right to pay the debt evidenced by this Note, in whole or in part, without charge or penalty, on the first day of any month. Lender shall accept prepayment on other days provided that Borrower pays interest on the amount prepaid for the remainder of the month to the extent required by Lender and permitted by regulations of the Secretary. If Borrower makes a partial prepayment, there will be no changes in the due date or in the amount of the monthly payment unless Lender agrees in writing to those changes.

**6\. BORROWER'S FAILURE TO PAY AS REQUIRED:**
**(A) Late Charge for Overdue Payments:** If Lender has not received the full monthly payment required by the Security Instrument, as described in Paragraph 4(a) of this Note, by the end of fifteen calendar days after the payment is due, Lender may collect a late charge in the amount of four percent (4.0%) of the overdue amount of each payment.

**(B) Default:** If Borrower defaults by failing to pay in full any monthly payment, then Lender may, except as limited by regulations of the Secretary in the case of payment defaults, require immediate payment in full of the principal balance remaining due and all accrued interest. Lender may choose not to exercise this option without waiving its rights in the event of any subsequent default. In many circumstances, regulations issued by the Secretary will limit Lender's rights to require immediate payment in full in the case of payment defaults. This Note does not authorize acceleration when not permitted by HUD regulations. As used in this Note, "Secretary" means the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or his or her designee.

**(C) Payment of Costs and Expenses:** If Lender has required immediate payment in full, as described above, Lender may require Borrower to pay costs and expenses including reasonable and customary attorney's fees for enforcing this Note to the extent not prohibited by applicable law. Such fees and costs shall bear interest from the date of disbursement at the same rate as the principal of this Note.

**7\. WAIVERS:** Borrower and any other person who has obligations under this Note waive the rights of presentment and notice of dishonor. "Presentment" means the right to require Lender to demand payment of amounts due. "Notice of dishonor" means the right to require Lender to give notice to other persons that amounts due have not been paid.

**8\. GIVING OF NOTICES:** Unless applicable law requires a different method, any notice that must be given to Borrower under this Note will be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to Borrower at the property address above or at a different address if Borrower has given Lender a notice of Borrower's different address. Any notice that must be given to Lender under this Note will be given by first class mail to Lender at the address stated in Paragraph 4(B) or at a different address if Borrower is given a notice of that different address.

**9\. OBLIGATIONS OF PERSONS UNDER THIS NOTE:** If more than one person signs this Note, each person is fully and personally obligated to keep all of the promises made in this Note, including the promise to pay the full amount owed. Any person who is a guarantor, surety, or endorser of this Note is also obligated to do these things. Any person who takes over these obligations, including the obligations of a guarantor, surety, or endorser of this Note, is also obligated to keep all of the promises made in this Note. Lender may enforce its rights under this Note against each person individually or against all signatories together. Any one person signing this Note may be required to pay all of the amounts owed under this Note.

BY SIGNING BELOW, Borrower accepts and agrees to the terms and covenants contained in this Note.

**MIN# 1000258-0000291313-3**

THIS DEED OF TRUST ("Security Instrument") is made on **OCTOBER 16, 2009**. The Grantor is **JEREMY L BASS, A MARRIED MAN AS HIS SOLE AND SEPARATE PROPERTY** ("Borrower"). The trustee is **FIDELITY NATIONAL TITLE INSURANCE CO., P.O. BOX 32695, PHOENIX, AZ 85064** ("Trustee"). The beneficiary is **Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. ("MERS")**, (solely as nominee for Lender, as hereinafter defined, and Lender's successors and assigns).

MERS is organized and existing under the laws of Delaware, and has an address and telephone number of P.O. Box 2026, Flint, MI 48501-2026, tel. (888) 679-MERS. BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., ("Lender") is organized and existing under the laws of the UNITED STATES, and has an address of 101 South Tryon Street, Charlotte, NC 28255.

Borrower owes Lender the principal sum of **ONE HUNDRED FORTY-EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FOURTEEN and 00/100 DOLLARS (U.S. $148,614.00)**. This debt is evidenced by Borrower's note dated the same date as this security instrument ("Note"), which provides for monthly payments, with the full debt, if not paid earlier, due and payable on **NOVEMBER 1, 2039**. This security instrument secures to Lender: (a) the repayment of the debt evidenced by the Note, with interest, and all renewals, extensions, and modifications of the Note; (b) the payment of all other sums, with interest, advanced under Paragraph 7 to protect the security of this Security Instrument; and (c) the performance of Borrower's covenants and agreements under this Security Instrument and the Note. For this purpose, Borrower irrevocably grants and conveys to the Trustee, in trust, with power of sale, the following described property located in
NEZ PERCE County, Idaho:
SEE EXHIBIT "A" ATTACHED HERETO AND MADE A PART HEREOF.

Parcel ID Number: Rprlo8B0010010AA

The property, which has the address of **1515 21ST AVE, LEWISTON, ID 83501-3926** ("Property Address"),

TOGETHER WITH all the improvements now or hereafter erected on the property, and all easements, appurtenances, and fixtures now or hereafter a part of the property. All replacements and additions shall also be covered by this Security Instrument. All of the foregoing is referred to in this Security Instrument as the "Property." Borrower understands and agrees that MERS holds only legal title to the interests granted by Borrower in this Security Instrument; but if necessary to comply with law or custom, MERS (as nominee for Lender and Lender's successors and assigns) has the right to exercise any or all of those interests, including, but not limited to, the right to foreclose and sell the Property; and to take any action required of Lender including, but not limited to, releasing or canceling this Security Instrument.

BORROWER COVENANTS that Borrower is lawfully seized of the estate hereby conveyed and has the right to grant and convey the Property and that the Property is unencumbered, except for encumbrances of record. Borrower warrants and will defend generally the title to the Property against all claims and demands, subject to any encumbrances of record.

THIS SECURITY INSTRUMENT combines uniform covenants for national use and non-uniform covenants with limited variations by jurisdiction to constitute a uniform security instrument covering real property. Borrower and Lender covenant and agree as follows:

**UNIFORM COVENANTS:**

**1\. Payment of Principal, Interest, and Late Charge:** Borrower shall pay when due the principal of, and interest on, the debt evidenced by the Note and late charges due under the Note.

**2\. Monthly Payment of Taxes, Insurance, and Other Charges:** Borrower shall include in each monthly payment together with the principal and interest as set forth in the Note and any late charges, a sum for (a) taxes and special assessments levied or to be levied against the Property, (b) leasehold payments or ground rents on the Property, and (c) premiums for insurance required under paragraph 4. In any year in which the Lender must pay a mortgage insurance premium to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development ("Secretary"), or in any year in which such premium would have been required if Lender still held the Security Instrument, each monthly payment shall also include either: (i) a sum for the annual mortgage insurance premium to be paid by Lender to the Secretary, or (ii) a monthly charge instead of a mortgage insurance premium if this Security Instrument is held by the Secretary, in a reasonable amount to be determined by the Secretary. Except for the monthly charge by the Secretary, these items are called "Escrow Items" and the sums paid to Lender are termed "Escrow Funds."

Lender may, at any time, collect and hold amounts for Escrow Items in an aggregate amount not to exceed the maximum amount that may be required for Borrower's escrow account under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, 12 U.S.C. Section 2601 et seq., and implementing regulations, 24 CFR Part 3500, as they may be amended from time to time ("RESPA"), except that the cushion or reserve permitted by RESPA for unanticipated disbursements or disbursements before the Borrower's payments are available in the account may not be based on amounts due for the mortgage insurance premium.

If the amounts held by Lender for Escrow Items exceed the amounts permitted to be held by RESPA, Lender shall account to Borrower for the excess funds as required by RESPA. If the amounts of funds held by Lender at any time are not sufficient to pay the Escrow Items when due, Lender may notify the Borrower and require Borrower to make up the shortage as permitted by RESPA.

The Escrow Funds are pledged as additional security for all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If Borrower tenders to Lender the full payment of all such sums, Borrower's account shall be credited with the balance remaining for all installment items (a), (b), and (c) and any mortgage insurance premium adjustment that Lender has not become obligated to pay to the Secretary, and Lender shall promptly refund any excess funds to Borrower. Immediately prior to a foreclosure sale of the Property or its acquisition by Lender, Borrower's account shall be credited with any balance remaining for all installments for items (a), (b), and (c).

**3\. Application of Payments:** All payments under paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be applied by Lender as follows:
__First__, to the mortgage insurance premium to be paid by Lender to the Secretary or to the monthly charge by the Secretary instead of the monthly mortgage insurance premium;
__second__, to any taxes, special assessments, leasehold payments or ground rents, and fire, flood, and other hazard insurance premiums, as required;
__third__, to interest due under the Note;
__fourth__, to amortization of the principal of the Note; and
__fifth__, to late charges due under the Note.

**4\. Fire, Flood, and Other Hazard Insurance:** Borrower shall insure all improvements on the property, whether now in existence or subsequently erected, against any hazards, casualties, and contingencies, including fire, for which Lender requires insurance. This insurance shall be maintained in the amounts and for the periods that Lender requires. Borrower shall also insure all improvements on the Property, whether now in existence or subsequently erected, against loss by floods to the extent required by the Secretary. All insurance shall be carried with companies approved by Lender. The insurance policies and any renewals shall be held by Lender and shall include loss payable clauses in favor of, and in a form acceptable to, Lender.

In the event of loss, Borrower shall give Lender immediate notice by mail. Lender may make proof of loss if not done promptly by Borrower. Each insurance company concerned is hereby authorized and directed to make payment for such loss directly to Lender, instead of to Borrower and to Lender jointly. All or any part of the insurance proceeds may be applied by Lender, at its option, either (a) to the reduction of the indebtedness under the Note and this Security Instrument, first to any delinquent amounts applied in the order in paragraph 3, and then to prepayment of principal, or (b) to the restoration or repair of the damaged Property. Any application of the proceeds to the principal shall not extend or postpone the due date of the monthly payments referred to in paragraph 2 or change the amount of such payments. Any excess insurance proceeds over an amount required to pay all outstanding indebtedness under the Note and this Security Instrument shall be paid to the entity legally entitled thereto.in the event of foreclosure of this Security Instrument or other transfer of title to the Property that extinguishes the indebtedness, all rights, title, and interest of Borrower in and to insurance policies in force shall pass to the purchaser.

**5\. Occupancy, Preservation, Maintenance, and Protection of the Property; Borrower's Loan Application; Leaseholds:** Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the Property as Borrower's principal residence within sixty days after the execution of this Security Instrument (or within sixty days of a later sale or transfer of the Property) and shall continue to occupy the Property as Borrower's principal residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender determines that requirement will cause undue hardship for Borrower, or unless extenuating circumstances exist which are beyond Borrower's control. Borrower shall not commit waste or destroy, damage or substantially change the Property or allow the Property to deteriorate, reasonable wear and tear excepted. Lender may inspect the Property if the Property is vacant or abandoned, or if the loan is in default. Lender may take reasonable action to protect and preserve such vacant or abandoned Property. Borrower shall also be in default if Borrower, during the loan application process, gave materially false or inaccurate information or statements to Lender (or failed to provide Lender with any material information) in connection with the loan evidenced by the Note, including, but not limited to, representations concerning Borrower's occupancy of the Property as a principal residence. If this Security Instrument is on a leasehold, Borrower shall comply with the provisions of the lease. If Borrower acquires fee title to the Property, the leasehold and fee title shall not be merged unless Lender agrees to the merger in writing.

**6\. Condemnation:** The proceeds of any award or claim for damages, direct or consequential, in connection with any condemnation or other taking of any part of the Property, or for conveyance in lieu of condemnation, are hereby assigned and shall be paid to Lender to the extent of the full amount of the indebtedness that remains unpaid under the Note and this Security Instrument. Lender shall apply such proceeds to the reduction of the indebtedness under the Note and this Security Instrument, first to any delinquent amounts applied in the order provided in paragraph 3, and then to prepayment of principal. Any application of the proceeds to the principal shall not extend or postpone the due date of the monthly payments referred to in paragraph 2, or change the amount of such payments. Any excess proceeds over an amount required to pay all outstanding indebtedness under the Note and this Security Instrument shall be paid to the entity legally entitled thereto.

**7\. Charges to Borrower and Protection of Lender's Rights in the Property:** Borrower shall pay all governmental or municipal charges, fines, and impositions that are not included in paragraph 2. Borrower shall pay these obligations on time directly to the entity which is owed the payment. If failure to pay would adversely affect Lender's interest in the property, upon Lender's request, Borrower shall promptly furnish to Lender receipts evidencing these payments.

If Borrower fails to make these payments or the payments required by paragraph 2, or fails to perform any other covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument, or there is a legal proceeding that may significantly affect Lender's rights in the Property (such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, for condemnation or to enforce laws or regulations), then Lender may do and pay whatever is necessary to protect the value of the Property and Lender's rights in the Property, including payment of taxes, hazard insurance, and other items mentioned in paragraph 2.

Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this paragraph shall become an additional debt of Borrower and be secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest from the date of disbursement, at the Note rate, and at the option of Lender, shall be immediately due and payable.

Borrower shall promptly discharge any lien which has priority over this Security Instrument unless Borrower: (a) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured by the lien in a manner acceptable to Lender; (b) contests in good faith the lien by, or defends against enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings which in Lender's opinion operate to prevent the enforcement of the lien; or (c) secures from the holder of the lien an agreement satisfactory to Lender subordinating the lien to this Security Instrument. If Lender determines that any part of the Property is subject to a lien which may attain priority over this Security Instrument, Lender may give Borrower a notice identifying the lien. Borrower shall satisfy the lien or take one or more of the actions set forth above within 10 days of the giving of notice.

**8\. Fees:** Lender may collect fees and charges authorized by the Secretary.
**9\. Grounds for Acceleration of Debt:**

**(a) Default:** Lender may, except as limited by regulations issued by the Secretary, in the case of payment defaults, require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument if:

(i) Borrower defaults by failing to pay in full any monthly payment required by this Security Instrument prior to or on the due date of the next monthly payment, or

(ii) Borrower defaults by failing, for a period of thirty days, to perform any other obligations contained in this Security Instrument.

**(b) Sale Without Credit Approval:** Lender may, if permitted by applicable law (including Section 341(d) of the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, 12 U.S.C. 1701j-3(d)) and with the prior approval of the Secretary, require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument if:

(i) All or part of the property, or a beneficial interest in a trust owning all or part of the property, is sold or otherwise transferred (other than by devise or descent), and

(ii) The property is not occupied by the purchaser or grantee as his or her principal residence, or the purchaser or grantee does so occupy the property but his or her credit has not been approved in accordance with the requirements of the Secretary.

**(c) No Waiver:** If circumstances occur that would permit Lender to require immediate payment in full, but Lender does not require such payments, Lender does not waive its rights with respect to subsequent events.

**(d) Regulations of HUD Secretary:** In many circumstances, regulations issued by the Secretary will limit Lender's rights, in the case of payment defaults, to require immediate payment in full and foreclose if not paid. This Security Instrument does not authorize acceleration or foreclosure if not permitted by regulations of the Secretary.

**(e) Mortgage Not Insured:** Borrower agrees that if this Security Instrument and the Note are not determined to be eligible for insurance under the National Housing Act within 60 days from the date thereof, Lender may, at its option, require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument.

A written statement of any authorized agent of the Secretary dated subsequent to 60 days from the date hereof declining to insure this Security Instrument and the Note, shall be deemed conclusive proof of such ineligibility. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this option may not be exercised by Lender when the unavailability of insurance is solely due to Lender's failure to remit a mortgage insurance premium to the Secretary.

**10\. Reinstatement:** Borrower has a right to be reinstated if Lender has required immediate payment in full because of Borrower's failure to pay an amount due under the Note or this Security Instrument. This right applies even after foreclosure proceedings are instituted. To reinstate the Security Instrument, Borrower shall tender in a lump sum all amounts required to bring Borrower's account current including, to the extent they are obligations of Borrower under this Security Instrument, foreclosure costs and reasonable and customary attorneys' fees and expenses properly associated with the foreclosure proceeding. Upon reinstatement by Borrower, this Security Instrument and the obligations that it secures shall remain in effect as if Lender had not required immediate payment in full. However, Lender is not required to permit reinstatement if:

(i) Lender has accepted reinstatement after the commencement of foreclosure proceedings within two years immediately preceding the commencement of a current foreclosure proceeding,

(ii) Reinstatement will preclude foreclosure on different grounds in the future, or

(iii) Reinstatement will adversely affect the priority of the lien created by this Security Instrument.

**Modification of This Security Instrument:** Modification of this Security Instrument at the discretion of Lender and in accordance with the policies of the Secretary without the consent of Borrower shall not operate to release the liability of the original Borrower or Borrower's successor in interest. Lender shall not be required to commence proceedings against any successor in interest or refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modify amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument by reason of any demand made by the original Borrower or Borrower's successors in interest. Any forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any right or remedy.

**12\. Successors and Assigns Bound; Joint and Several Liability; Cosigners:** The covenants and agreements of this Security Instrument shall bind and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender and Borrower, subject to the provisions of paragraph 9. Borrower's covenants and agreements shall be joint and several. Any Borrower who cosigns this Security Instrument but does not execute the Note: (a) is cosigning this Security Instrument only to mortgage, grant, and convey that Borrower's interest in the property under the terms of this Security Instrument, (b) is not personally obligated to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument, and (c) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower may agree to extend, modify, forbear, or make any accommodations with regard to the terms of this Security Instrument or the Note without that Borrower's consent.

**13\. Notices:** Any notice to Borrower provided for in this Security Instrument shall be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first-class mail unless applicable law requires the use of another method. The notice shall be directed to the Property Address or any other address Borrower designates by notice to Lender. Any notice to Lender shall be given by mailing to the address specified for notices to Lender, any change in which Lender shall notify Borrower in accordance with the provisions in this paragraph.

**14\. Governing Law; Severability:** This Security Instrument shall be governed by federal law and the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located. In the event that any provision or clause of this Security Instrument or the Note conflicts with applicable law, such conflict shall not affect other provisions of this Security Instrument or the Note which can be given effect without the conflicting provision. To this end, the provisions of this Security Instrument and the Note are declared to be severable.

**15\. Borrower's Copy:** Borrower shall be provided with a copy of this Security Instrument.

**16\. Hazardous Substances:** Borrower shall not cause or permit the presence, use, disposal, storage, or release of any Hazardous Substances on or in the Property. Borrower shall not do, nor allow anyone else to do, anything affecting the Property that is in violation of any Environmental Law. The preceding two sentences shall not apply to the presence, use, or storage on the Property of small quantities of Hazardous Substances that are generally recognized to be appropriate to normal residential uses and to maintenance of the Property.

Borrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of any investigation, claim, demand, lawsuit, or other action by any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property and any Hazardous Substance or Environmental Law of which Borrower has actual knowledge. If Borrower learns, or is notified by any governmental or regulatory authority, that any removal or other remediation of any Hazardous Substances affecting the Property is necessary, Borrower shall promptly take all necessary remedial actions in accordance with Environmental Law.

As used in this paragraph 16, "Hazardous Substances" are those substances defined as toxic or hazardous substances by Environmental Law and the following substances: gasoline, kerosene, other flammable or toxic petroleum products, toxic pesticides and herbicides, volatile solvents, materials containing asbestos or formaldehyde, and radioactive materials. As used in this paragraph 16, "Environmental Law" means federal laws and laws of the jurisdiction where the Property is located that relate to health, safety, or environmental protection.

**NON-UNIFORM COVENANTS:** Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:

**17\. Assignment of Rents:** To the extent permitted by applicable law, Borrower unconditionally assigns and transfers to Lender all the rents and revenues of the Property. Borrower authorizes Lender or Lender's agents to collect the rents and revenues and hereby directs each tenant of the Property to pay the rents to Lender or Lender's agents. However, prior to Lender's notice to Borrower of Borrower's breach of any covenant or agreement in the Security Instrument, Borrower shall collect and receive all rents and revenues of the Property as trustee for the benefit of Lender and Borrower. This assignment of rents constitutes an absolute assignment and not an assignment for additional security only.

If Lender gives notice of breach to Borrower: (a) all rents received by Borrower shall be held by Borrower as trustee for the benefit of Lender only, to be applied to the sums secured by the Security Instrument, (b) Lender shall be entitled to collect and receive all of the rents of the Property, and (c) each tenant of the Property shall pay all rents due and unpaid to Lender or Lender's agent on Lender's demand to the tenant. Borrower has not executed any prior assignment of the rents and has not and will not perform any act that would prevent Lender from exercising its rights under this paragraph 17. Lender shall not be required to enter upon, take control of, or maintain the Property before or after giving notice of breach to Borrower. However, Lender or a judicially appointed receiver may do so at any time there is a breach. Any application of rents shall not cure or waive any default or invalidate any other right or remedy of Lender. This assignment of rents of the Property shall terminate when the debt secured by the Security Instrument is paid in full.

**18\. Foreclosure Procedure: If Lender requires immediate payment in full under paragraph 9, Lender may invoke the power of sale and any other remedies permitted by applicable law. Lender shall be entitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing the remedies provided in this paragraph 18, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of title evidence.**

**If Lender invokes the power of sale, Lender shall execute or cause Trustee to execute a written notice of the occurrence of an event of default and of Lender's election to cause the Property to be sold, and shall cause such notice to be recorded in each county in which any part of the Property is located. Trustee shall mail copies of the notice as prescribed by applicable law to Borrower and to other persons prescribed by applicable law. Trustee shall give public notice of sale to the persons and in the manner prescribed by applicable law. After the time required by applicable law, Trustee, without demand on Borrower, shall sell the Property at public auction to the highest bidder at the time and place and under the terms designated in the notice of sale in one or more parcels and in any order Trustee determines. Trustee may postpone any sale of all or any parcel of the Property by public announcement at the time and place of any previously scheduled sale. Lender or its designee may purchase the property at any sale.**

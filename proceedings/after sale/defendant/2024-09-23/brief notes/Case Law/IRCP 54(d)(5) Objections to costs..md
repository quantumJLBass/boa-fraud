IRCP 54(d)(5) Objections to costs. Within 14 days of service of a memorandum of costs, any
party may object by filing and serving a motion to disallow part or all of the costs. The
motion does not stay execution on the judgment, exclusive of costs, and must be
heard and determined by the court as other motions under these rules. Failure to
timely object to the items in the memorandum of costs constitutes a waiver of all
objections to the costs claimed.


IRCP 54(e)(2) Pursuant to Idaho Code Section 12-121.Pursuant to the statutory amendment
effective March 1, 2017, attorney fees under Idaho Code Section 12-121 may be
awarded by the court only when it finds that the case was brought, pursued or
defended frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation, which finding must be in
writing and include the basis and reasons for the award. No attorney fees may be
awarded pursuant to Idaho Code Section 12-121 on a default judgment.


IRCP 54(e)(6) Objection to attorney fees. Any objection to a claim for attorney fees must be
made in the same manner as an objection to costs as provided by Rule 54(d)(5). The
court may conduct an evidentiary hearing, if it deems it necessary, regarding the
award of attorney fees.



I.R.C.P. 11(a)(2)





Discretion of Court.
Summary judgment may be rendered for any party, not just the moving party, and on any or all
of the causes of action involved, under the rules of civil procedure; flexibility in designing
summary judgment orders is clearly the intent


Motion to strike




When the party moving for summary judgment will not carry the burden of production or proof
at trial, the "genuine issue of material fact" burden may be met by establishing the absence of
evidence on an element that the nonmoving party will be required to prove at trial. Once such an
absence of evidence has been established, the burden then shifts to the party opposing the
motion to establish, via further depositions, discovery responses or affidavits, that there is
indeed a genuine issue for trial, or to offer a valid justification for the failure to do so under this
rule. Sanders v. Kuna Joint Sch. Dist., 125 Idaho 872, 876 P.2d 154 (Ct. App. 1994).


Mere denials, assertions of what "might have been," of what one has "been told" or "advised,"
of matters not stated from personal knowledge, of numerous legal conclusions, (especially by
laymen), and of what one hopes "will be shown at the trial" are not enough to create a "genuine
issue". Tri-State Nat'l Bank v. Western Gateway Storage Co., 92 Idaho 543, 447 P.2d 409
(1968).

Motion for summary judgment should be denied where definite conflict is shown by the
instruments upon which the motion was granted. Hansen v. Howard O. Miller, Inc., 93 Idaho
314, 460 P.2d 739 (1969).


Where the record showed no genuine issue of material fact the trial court was correct, as a
matter of law, in granting a summary judgment. Yribar v. Fitzpatrick, 87 Idaho 366, 393 P.2d 588
(1964); Minidoka County ex rel. Detweiler Bros. v. Krieger, 88 Idaho 395, 399 P.2d 962 (1964).
In passing on a motion under former identical rule or a motion under I.R.C.P. 12(b)(6) treated
as such, the court must not try issues of fact, but only determine if issues of fact exist and if the
facts are material. Stewart v. Arrington Constr. Co., 92 Idaho 526, 446 P.2d 895 (1968).

A mere scintilla of evidence will not create an issue; there must be evidence upon which a jury
can rely. Jephson v. Ambuel, 93 Idaho 790, 473 P.2d 932 (1970).


Summary judgment can be granted only when there is no genuine issue of material fact and
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Schaefer v. Elswood Trailer Sales,
95 Idaho 654, 516 P.2d 1168 (1973).

Since a summary judgment, interlocutory in character, may be rendered on the issue of liability
alone, although there is a genuine issue as to the amount of damages, appellant employee
could be compensated for what he had parted with, his work already performed under an oral
Page 75 of 82

contract of employment and the expenses of moving his family to the place of his employment.
Allen v. Moyle, 84 Idaho 18, 367 P.2d 579 (1961).
An interlocutory summary judgment is not appealable. Lloyd v. Lloyd, 95 Idaho 108, 503 P.2d
308 (1972).

A motion for summary judgment should be denied where the matters submitted in support of
and in opposition to the motion show a genuine issue as to any material fact, as where a lending
corporation contracted to make payments from a construction loan direct to the contractor and
defended against such obligation in a suit by the contractor on the ground of lack of
consideration and the contractor contended he was induced by such agreement to contract with
the owner-borrower. H.A. Day v. Mortgage Ins. Corp., 91 Idaho 605, 428 P.2d 524 (1967).

To forestall a summary judgment, factual disputes must concern an issue of material fact.
American Mach. Co. v. Fitzpatrick, 92 Idaho 416, 443 P.2d 1013 (1968).


If a party moves for summary judgment on the basis of an affirmative defense which entitles
him to judgment as a matter of law, and if there is no genuine dispute of material fact as to that
defense, even though a dispute of fact may exist as to the merits of the plaintiff's claim,
summary judgment should be granted. Collord v. Cooley, 92 Idaho 789, 451 P.2d 535 (1969).


A summary judgment cannot be granted where there are any disputed issues of material fact.
D & M Dev. Co. v. Sherwood & Roberts, Inc., 93 Idaho 200, 457 P.2d 439 (1969).


In determining whether any issue of material fact is in dispute, it is well settled that the facts
should be liberally construed in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.
Straley v. Idaho Nuclear Corp., 94 Idaho 917, 500 P.2d 218 (1972); First Piedmont Bank & Trust
Co. v. Doyle, 97 Idaho 700, 551 P.2d 1336 (1976), overruled on other grounds, Yacht Club
Sales & Serv., Inc. v. First Nat'l Bank, 101 Idaho 852, 623 P.2d 464 (1980).

Summary judgment is improper when a conflict in affidavits respecting issues of fact exists or
when the relevant pleadings, depositions and affidavits raise any question of credibility of
witnesses, but a mere scintilla of evidence will not create a genuine issue of material fact
sufficient to preclude summary judgment. Straley v. Idaho Nuclear Corp., 94 Idaho 917, 500
P.2d 218 (1972); Hutchins v. Trombley, 95 Idaho 360, 509 P.2d 579 (1973).

In action for specific performance of offer to buy where there was a question of whether the
parties intended the writings involved to be offers, whether there was an effective revocation if
there were valid offers and whether there was an unqualified acceptance of any valid offer,
granting of summary judgment was error. Turner v. Mendenhall, 95 Idaho 426, 510 P.2d 490
(1973); Hutchins v. Trombley, 95 Idaho 360, 509 P.2d 579 (1973).
*************************************
Motion for summary judgment dismissing cause for lack of jurisdiction over subject matter
could be more correctly viewed as a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction over the subject
matter pursuant to Rule 12(b). Stample v. Idaho Power Co., 92 Idaho 763, 450 P.2d 610 (1969).


The position that summary judgment should not be granted if there is the slightest doubt as to
the facts has been rejected; the purpose of the former identical rule was to allow the court to
pierce the pleadings in order to eliminate groundless denials and paper issues in cases which
would end in directed verdicts or other rulings of law. Hall v. Bacon, 93 Idaho 1, 453 P.2d 816
(1969).

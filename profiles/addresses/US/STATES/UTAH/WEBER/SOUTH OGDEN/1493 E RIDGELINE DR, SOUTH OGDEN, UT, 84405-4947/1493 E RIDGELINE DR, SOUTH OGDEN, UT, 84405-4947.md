I've been coming here for my taxes for 2 years straight, and they are incredibly professional.

Reception is super helpful with any questions I have, and they explain everything thoroughly. The same goes for the accountants.

All the files are accessible to download online, too. Just bring in the tax files, and you get your taxes done the next few days.

Well worth the money.

Unbelievably bad experience. We have 9 different business and needed to file an extension. Our taxes were turned over to one of the associates there. Every time we called to talk to her, the receptionist told us she would return our call. She never did. When the extension due date came, we received an email confirmation that our extensions had been filed and also talked to the receptionist who told us they had to all be sent in separately and it was a painstaking process but that the extensions were all filed. We called a week later to talk to the accountant and we were again told she would call us back but I insisted on waiting. Thirty minutes later she got on the phone and acted like she didn’t even know who we were and informed us the extensions had NEVER been filed and really acted like she could care less. I don’t know of a time where I’ve received this bad of service from anyone. Left a message and an email for Jake to call and he never did. Absolutely unbelievable and unacceptable service and care for their customers. Wouldn’t trust these people to tie my shoe.

The team has helped me to solve problems that were caused by the "other" tax prepares that do mass amounts of taxes with no relationship.  Jake is always available to give me advice on how to handle situations that effect my taxes and finances.  I feel welcome when I am in the office and I know that they are ethical so I wont be have issues down the road.  I will continue to use their services and recommend you do as well.  Five Stars!!

I have disappointedly used four other accountants in the past.  Jake has consistently been able to answer my questions and take care of the preparation and filings needed.  What I like about Jake the most is his ability to explain things so I can understand them.  I would highly recommend Jake to any business owner and or any person looking to have a professional handle their accounting.

We hired Integrated Tax to do our 2016 taxes. Shortly after we received a letter from the State of Utah that there were mathematical errors on our return. In the end, we were supposed to be issued a refund but instead we actually had to pay because of these errors. I contacted the accountant and he refused to fix his mistake or pro-rate our fee. The letter from the state clearly stated in more than one location that there was "miscalculations and a mathematical error". This should have been fixed. Good customer service starts there. Would give half a star if I could. Save yourself the hassle and hire someone else. The Drokes.

I met Jake in Ogden, Utah just after finishing a 6 1/2 year IRS tax audit, so I know what I want in a tax preparation and tax representation service.  He is truly a tax expert.  His work is clean and the IRS respects his work.  That is a big deal when you are sitting across the table from them negotiating your tax return.
